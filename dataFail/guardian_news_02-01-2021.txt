At its most primal, it involves deliberately releasing animals such as beavers or wolves in the belief that the re-entry of a single alpha species brings with it a cascade of ecological benefits.', 'Either way, rewilding has come to be associated with big acreages, whether that be at Knepp Park in Sussex or at the 18,000-acre Glenfeshie estate in the Cairngorms. The perception is that it is expensive, far away and often inaccessible. It certainly isn’t something that just anyone can do.', 'But what if the wildest places of all were right under our feet? In the forgotten spaces in our cities, rewilding has always happened naturally, , land falling under stone and resurging again, concrete lids flipped off before submerging once more. In the margins and the demilitarised zones, the abandoned embankments, the bits we don’t want or the lands already contaminated beyond human tolerance, ecology is thriving.', 'In some places – such as the land around the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine – plant and insect life has adapted to the extreme conditions: boars have moved in, there is a new radiation-munching fungus and, in the thin strip of no-man’s land between the borders of North and South Korea, leopards and Asiatic black bears have been spotted. In the past century, Greenham Common in Berkshire has transformed from open heathland grazing to the home of US Trident missiles to an SSSI nature reserve with a weedy runway.', 'In ', 'Scotland', ', the 40-mile strip between Glasgow and Edinburgh has always been mined, for not just coal, but stone, gravel, lead and even gold. After centuries of hard pickings, parts of Lanarkshire and Ayrshire have an upended appearance. What was underground is now on top and what was above has gone below, with buildings and bridges slumped over old drift mines and razor-lined spoil heaps terraced by extraction tracks. Wildfowl nest on lochs made from old coal holes and an orchid called Young’s helleborine, discovered in 1975, favours only the best iron ore.', 'The Ardeer peninsula in Ayrshire is home to the unusually bracing combination of a nudist beach and an explosives factory once owned and operated by the Alfred Nobel Company. Parts of the site are still in use, but most of the 330-acre site was long ago abandoned. Along the cracks in the old pipelines and through the decaying buildings, it would be quicker to list the native plants that are no longer there than those that are.', 'In theory, industry and mining companies are supposed to follow restoration plans for abandoned sites, but in practice they often plead poverty. Besides, ecologists sometimes find themselves ensnared in a paradox. Public feeling is that big business should be obliged to make good what it has taken, but human attempts to restore land are often amateurish. Planting a few conifers and flinging around a mix of wildflowers may be a quick fix, but sometimes it appears that the best thing to do is nothing.', 'The M74 motorway runs up the front of Scotland past new windfarms and second world war PoW camps. Not far from Broken Cross, Europe’s largest opencast coal mine, there’s ', 'Castle Dangerous', '. In 1913 the 13th Earl of Home tried to lift local unemployment at Douglas by allowing mining nearby. The mining unseated the castle, it was demolished, and the flooded workings (known locally as the Black Hole) are now so patterned with commuting birdlife that it resembles an avian Heathrow.', 'Further up the motorway, near Port Glasgow, the old timber ponds attract birds of a seaborne kind. The ponds are shallow estuarine mudflats divided by ancient wooden stakes (or stabs) and were once used to grade and store logs for shipbuilding. It is an atmospheric place, the stabs shrouded in black weed like cartoon ghouls while beyond them the lights of Dunbarton shine over the water. Poking around in the mud and sunken tyres I hear a curlew for the first time this year, its song for an instant rhyming with an ambulance siren.', 'On the other side of the Clyde, between the Erskine Bridge and the old John Brown shipyard, lies what used to be the Beardmore naval construction works in Dalmuir. In the early 20th century it produced munitions, planes, submarines and warships before being converted into a fuel-supply depot and then being gradually abandoned.', 'Now a cycle path runs through it, but otherwise there is nothing new here except nature: golden leaves of birch springing from the concrete jetty, hawkweed drifting Ophelia-like in the drowned oil storage tanks, wrens nesting in the rusted embankments, mallards cackling from the blackthorn scrub. “Have you seen the deer?” asks a dog walker. There are two, apparently – one red, one roe, both favouring the grazing just beneath the giant electricity pylon.', 'Dalmuir is beautiful, dangerous – and almost certainly contaminated. Like many of the other sites, it has always been used by more than just squirrels and crows. Since industry retreated it has been a flytip, a heroin shooting gallery and probably a place to dispose of worse things than just old mattresses.', 'Halflands like these can be among the most joyous and optimistic places on earth, but they can also carry with them a polluting sense of menace. Finding them means that you may end up meandering across an indeterminate line between a walk in the park and full-scale urban exploration; you explore at your own risk. Some places encourage public interest and others, despite Scotland’s differing access laws, discourage it.', 'They also have a habit of vanishing. Brownfield sites tend to be classified as wasteland, and with the pressure on housing, they are first in line for redevelopment. Ardeer is intended for “regeneration” and Dalmuir will shortly be dug up to make way for the Scottish Marine Technology Park, a deepwater ship hoist and a new small-vessel fabrication yard. Malin Group, which owns the site, says it will create 600 short-term jobs and give a multimillion-pound boost to the local economy, which it claims is “sure to bring back to life this area of the river”.']

Floods, storms and searing heat: 2020 in extreme weather:	['This year has broken a series of unwelcome weather records. Last month was the warmest November in history.

Famously, the Hungarian government has trampled on academic freedom by ', 'making it impossible', ' for the Central European University in Budapest to operate – the first time a university has been forced into exile since the War. In Poland, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party took control of the formerly independent National Council of Judiciary – ensuring that appointment, promotion and disciplining of the nation’s judges was to be decided by party loyalists.', 'As I write, PKN Orlen, Poland’s state-run oil company, ', 'has just bought Polska Press', ', a private media outlet that reaches 11 million Poles every day.

In a major', ' survey', ' of citizens, last year, two-thirds of Poles (64%) indicated that they thought the rule of law was being undermined in their country. While, in Hungary, 58% of respondents felt that their political system was “broken”.', 'I still remember the celebrations in my home town when Hungary joined the ', 'European Union', ' in 2004.

Cities can lead a green revolution after Covid. In Barcelona, we're showing how:	['T', 'he pandemic will leave behind a very different world from that of a year ago. Thousands of people have died; entire industries have been brought to the brink; welfare states have been shaken. In the coming years, the major challenge facing all public leaders will be charting a path of recovery through the devastating human, social and economic marks that Covid-19 has left on our societies.', 'But rather than redoubling on the fragile world of the pre-pandemic age, we should be taking advantage of this moment to build one that is more just, balanced and sustainable.', 'Cities will play a key role in this process. Barcelona and its metropolitan area want to lead the response to one of the toughest situations that humanity has faced in modern times. Achieving this will mean tackling two interrelated challenges. We need to continue the fight against the climate crisis, spurred by the ', 'European Green Deal', '. And we will need to boost the post-Covid economy through green technologies, sustainable industry and transport.', 'Although these are global issues, change can begin in urban centres. Cities can play a pivotal role in transitioning energy use away from fossil fuels. They can adopt ', 'non-polluting modes of transport', ' and build green public spaces that absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.', 'Barcelona has long been committed to these goals. Over the next decade, our ', '“superblock', '” plan will transform the entire central grid of the city into a greener, pedestrian-friendly and almost car-free area. We’ll extend this model to the entirety of the ', 'Eixample district', ', first designed in the late 19th century by the urban planner Ildefons Cerdà, who envisioned an integrated, modernist extension to Barcelona based around a grid system, providing new public spaces for mobility and recreation.', 'The Covid-19 crisis has reminded us all of the importance of scientific advances. Progress in areas such as vaccines and testing are what will provide the exit route from this pandemic. Cities can play a role in nurturing science, technology and digital industries, something ', 'Barcelona', ' has been doing for years, through public policies aimed at attracting talent and building new infrastructures.', 'Our city is home to the MareNostrum 5 European supercomputer, for example. Built by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, this new type of computer can be used in areas such as human genome research, the design of new drugs and weather forecasting. And as mayor of Barcelona, I’m currently reviewing the proposal that the Spanish government has made to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts to make Barcelona the headquarters of this important institution, whose forecasting skills and environmental expertise are key to the fight against climate breakdown.', 'Our aim is to become the major scientific and cultural capital of the Mediterranean, driving Europe’s transition towards a green and circular economy. And we can do so through the innovative, courageous and resourceful spirit that has long characterised our city, working to improve the quality of life of our neighbours, and ensuring that our post-pandemic society leaves nobody behind.', 'Yet while cities can be leaders on these issues, it’s clear that they cannot – and should not – be doing this alone. Different levels of government should be working together with both public and private actors if we are going to be successful in the fight against the climate crisis and in building an equitable, green economic recovery. These are global challenges, and they will require international solutions. But cities are a good place to start.', '•', ' Ada Colau is the mayor of Barcelona']
Unlike Trump, Europe's far-right leaders haven't been damaged by the pandemic:	['B', 'y now it is almost received wisdom that “populists” (often used as a euphemism for “the far right”) have ignored the threat of Covid-19, that populists have been the electoral victims of the pandemic, and that the pandemic has exposed the political incompetence of populists in government.', 'Most of this speculation is based on one or two individual cases, most notably the US president, Donald Trump. But he is the exception rather than the rule. In a recent ', 'comparative study', ' of far-right parties in the European Union, we found that none of those three assumptions holds up to scrutiny. In fact, there has been significant variety in far-right responses to the pandemic.', 'In contrast to Trump, most European far-right parties were quick to point to the danger of the virus to the point of outright alarmism, although many started to walk that back after the number of cases had peaked, and some even started to spread misinformation. Matteo Salvini and his League party in Italy saw the virus as a major threat, but with time opinions on Covid started to fluctuate. The main reason was that the most affected regions in Italy were governed by the League. Consequently, the party went from Salvini’s ', 'alarmist appeals', ' to close the borders and ban the Chinese new year, to claims that the virus was not that bad by the League governor of the ', 'hardest-hit province, Lombardy', '.', 'Many far-right parties in opposition initially criticised their governments for responding too slowly, but quickly became the loudest critics of the alleged “anti-democratic” and “unconstitutional” government policies when lockdowns were introduced. For instance, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) argued that freedom of speech was “the clearest victim of corona”, while the Austrian Freedom party (FPÖ) claimed that it had stopped “totalitarian” surveillance plans.', 'By contrast, far-right parties in government implicated the opposition in spreading the virus or frustrating the national response. For instance, the Hungarian government targeted the mayor of Budapest for mismanaging the situation, while Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki argued that the opposition, “instead of taking care of peace and helping, threw sand in the modes”.', 'The second misperception is that far-right parties have been the big losers of the pandemic – recently strengthened by the claim that Trump lost the election because of Covid-19. However, in our study of 31 far-right parties in EU member states, only half lost some support in the first, more acute, coronavirus wave, from mid-March to mid-June. Of the rest, five gained support, and 10 experienced no change in the polls. Moreover, the overall effect was marginal, within 1% on average. Far-right parties have started to lose a bit more during the continuing second wave, although the averages remain small and within the polls’ margin of error.', 'Once again, government status seems to play a role. The far-right parties in control in Hungary and Poland mostly gained in the first wave but lost the most in the second wave. Far-right parties in governing coalitions were initially not affected but have now seen some small losses. And far-right parties in opposition, the vast majority, experienced some small losses in the first wave that have largely disappeared in the second wave.', 'So, did the', ' ', 'pandemic expose “the incompetence” of the far right in power? The European data provides little evidence for this. Countries with far-right governments adopted the strictest measures of all; and while those with far-right parties in coalition took less severe measures, it is hard to assess those parties’ roles. And in terms of cases and deaths per population, the numbers are mostly lower for countries with far-right parties in government or in coalition than for countries where the far right is in opposition.', 'It should be noted that all the countries with far-right government participation are in central and eastern ', 'Europe', ', the region least hit by Covid-19 in the first wave. Still, even here countries with far-right parties in government did slightly better than other countries in the region.', 'In short, much of the public debate about the far right, populism and Covid-19 is wrong. Overall, the far right has not ignored Covid-19, has not been its electoral victim, and has not been exposed as incompetent by the pandemic. While the far right has generally framed Covid-19 and the pandemic in line with its ideology (nativism, authoritarianism, and populism), its policy responses have differed, mainly based on whether they are in government or opposition.', 'More than anything, these findings show that we should stop viewing the European far right through the prism of Trump.

'It's as if we've learned nothing': alarm over Amazon road project:	['B', 'razilian activists have voiced alarm over their government’s plans to bulldoze a 94-mile highway through a biodiverse corner of the Amazon along the border with Peru that is home to at least three indigenous communities.', 'The planned road is an extension of ', 'the BR-364', ', a 2,700-mile highway that links São Paulo with the Amazon state of Acre, and would connect the town of Cruzeiro do Sul with the Peruvian border town of Pucallpa.', 'Backers of the “transoceanic” project, who include Brazil’s president, ', 'Jair Bolsonaro', ', argue it will boost the economy of this remote region by creating a transport hub through which agricultural products can be shipped to Pacific ports in Peru and on to China.', '“This project won’t destroy the forest, it will bring sustainable development to the region by heating up commercial and cultural relations [with Peru],” said Mara Rocha, a centre-right congresswoman from Acre who supports the idea.', 'Rocha said the project was critical to a region that felt “forgotten and invisible to the rest of the country”. Opponents, however, fear it could have catastrophic consequences for Brazil’s environment, which is already reeling under Bolsonaro as the ', 'rate of Amazon deforestation soars', ' to its highest level in more than a decade.', 'A ', 'report', ' in the Estado de São Paulo newspaper said an 80-mile (130km) stretch of pristine forest would need to be felled to build the road, which would cut through the centre of the protected Serra do Divisor national park. Experts call the park ', 'one of the Amazon’s most biodiverse regions', ', hosting at least 130 species of mammal and more than 400 species of bird. Brazilian lawmakers are considering plans to water down its protections in an apparent attempt to accelerate the road’s construction.', 'Luís Puwe Puyanawa, a local indigenous leader who opposes the project, said: “The truth is that nobody in Acre needs this transoceanic route – there’s already a road linking us to Peru. What we need is to leave the forest standing.”', 'Miguel Scarcello, the head of SOS Amazônia, an environmental group based in the state capital, Rio Branco, described the project as “irresponsible” and a throwback to Brazil’s military dictatorship when roads where bulldozed through the Amazon in an attempt to populate and develop the region.', '“It’s such an old-fashioned, backwards vision … that pays absolutely no attention to conservation. It will cut through an untouched area of forest and affect the headwaters of really important tributaries of the Juruá River,” Scarcello said.', 'He described how during the 1964-85 dictatorship such roads “decimated” indigenous communities and inflicted “immense destruction” on the rainforest, as loggers used them to access previously inaccessible areas. “We’re not in the 1960s any more,” Scarcello said. “It’s as if we’ve learned nothing from the effects that this could cause and how much destruction could be caused.”', 'He added: “They say it will bring development but, as always, it will be development for half a dozen people,” and he warned of a “carnival of land grabbing” that would accompany the planned road.', 'If the project is approved, three indigenous communities near the road will reportedly be affected: ', 'Nukini', ', ', 'Jaminawa', ' and ', 'Poyanawa', '. Scarcello said it was possible the national park was also home to isolated tribes with whom contact had not been made.', 'Puyanawa, 41, said he feared his community would be worst hit. “The road is expected to pass within about a kilometre of our lands. One of my biggest concerns is that this stretch is home to some of the most important water sources of the Amazon basin. The Alto Juruá provides all the waters that flow into the Rio Solimões and then Rio Negro, until they reach the sea,” he said. “All of these rivers could be really affected and this could cause the disappearance of important headwaters in the Amazon. With that, many species could disappear.”', 'Puyanawa said plans for such a route had been touted by politicians for decades but appeared to have accelerated since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019. “Nobody has wanted it as much as Bolsonaro,” he said.', 'Bolsonaro has overseen a highly controversial dismantling of Brazil’s environmental protection system, causing Amazon deforestation to skyrocket, critics say. Last month government figures showed Amazon destruction had surged to a 12-year high, with an area seven times larger than Greater London lost between August 2019 and July 2020.', 'That increase has been blamed on the feeling of impunity that Bolsonaro’s presidency has brought illegal loggers, cattle ranchers and miners seeking to cash in. “They feel completely at ease,” said Carlos Rittl, a Brazilian environmentalist who works at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Germany. “We are being governed by people whose motto for the environment is: destruction.”', 'The BR-364', ' extension, which Bolsonaro has ', 'publicly backed', ' as a means to give Brazil “a passage to the Pacific”, is not the only Amazon road project worrying environmentalists and climate campaigners.', 'Last week his administration said it would begin repaving ', 'the BR-319', ', a decaying dictatorship-era highway that cuts north to south through the Amazon from Manaus to Porto Velho. “A historic day for the north!” Bolsonaro wrote on Facebook, announcing the news.', 'But in ', 'a recent essay', ', Prof Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at Brazil’s National Institute for Amazonian Research, said reviving the BR-319, which has been abandoned since late 1980s, “would give deforesters access to about half of what remains of the country’s Amazon forest” and was “certainly among the most consequential decisions facing Brazil today”.']

Many wept tears of joy. Victory music kicked in and green smoke filled the air. A triumphant message flashed up on a big screen above the joyful crowd: “We did it!” it said. “ES LEY!” (IT’S LAW!).', '“I’m very emotional,” said 25-year-old Melany Marcati, who was among the celebrators. “There are no words to describe what your body feels after fighting for something for so long. I cried a lot, which I wasn’t expecting.”', 'The campaigner Ingrid Beck said: “The struggle for women’s rights is always arduous, and this time we even had to contend with a pandemic, so I am overjoyed with this result.”', 'The bill, which legalises terminations in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, ', 'was approved by Argentina’s lower house earlier this month', ' after being put to congress by the country’s leftwing president, ', 'Alberto Fernández', '.', '“Safe, legal and free abortion is now law … Today we are a better society,” Fernández ', 'celebrated', ' on Twitter after the result was confirmed.', 'Fernández has previously said that more than 3,000 women had died as a result of unsafe, underground abortions in Argentina since the return of democracy in 1983.', 'The landmark decision means Argentina becomes only the third South American country to permit elective abortions, alongside Uruguay, which decriminalised the practice in 2012, and Guyana, where it has been legal since 1995.', 'Cuba legalised the practice in 1965 while Mexico City and the Mexican state of Oaxaca also allow terminations.', 'Giselle Carino, an Argentinian feminist activist, said she believed the achievement in the home country of Pope Francis would reverberate across a region that is home to powerful Catholic and evangelical churches and some of the harshest abortion laws in the world.', 'In most countries, such as Brazil, abortions are only permitted in extremely limited circumstances such as rape or risk to the mother’s life, while in some, such as the Dominican Republic and El Salvador, they are banned altogether.', '“I feel incredibly proud of what we’ve been able to achieve.

Today in Argentina there’s no law giving the death penalty to rapists or murderers. So we’re feeling sad, to put it lightly.”', 'Carino said the leftward political shift that brought Fernández to power had undoubtedly boosted the pro-choice campaign after the previous year’s setback. Among those who helped Fernández win office were many young women who took part in the #NiUnaMenos protests and were voting for the first time.', 'Carino said the real credit lay with Argentina’s indefatigable women “who never stopped occupying the streets and the social networks – not even against the backdrop of the pandemic – and kept up their struggle, without haste but without rest”.', '“If anything made the difference, it was this.”']

The most eventful English League Christmas Day seems to have been 25 December 1957, when Chelsea beat Portsmouth 7-4 at home in Division One and Swansea beat Bristol Rovers 6-4 at home in Division 2.”', 'We should obviously mention the Christmas Truce match played on No Man’s Land which, ', 'if it actually happened', ', is about as eventful as festive football gets.', 'If we stick with the theme of the often wild days of wartime football, we can find a Christmas Day scoreline that would look ludicrous after 12 sherries, never mind while stone cold sober: Norwich 18-0 Brighton.', 'Yes, you read that right.

2020 wasn't all bad: sporting tales that lifted the lockdown gloom:	['L', 'et’s be honest – it has not been the sporting year any of us wanted, even if you are a Liverpool fan. But sprinkled among the tales of empty stadiums and Covid-19 tests there have been a few more offbeat stories to raise a chuckle and, in some cases, lift the heart as well:', 'You have probably accused your team’s defence of socially distancing at some point in the past nine months. But in September a football club in Germany did it for real. SG Ripdorf/Molzen II from Lower Saxony’s 3 Kreisklasse – the country’s 11', 'th', ' tier – fielded seven players against their local rivals SV Holdenstedt II after it emerged their opponents had been in contact with a player infected with Covid-19 during a recent match. Those who showed up for the game kicked off, stood aside and let Holdenstedt rattle in 37 goals without reply. Their story became a viral sensation, and it took some time for things to die down.', 'Holdenstedt found themselves on the wrong end of a hammering, this time via social media, for inflicting such punishment and the clubs held a meeting to smooth things over. There are, we are happy to confirm, no problems between them. The season rolled along as normal for a while, Ripdorf/Molzen reporting no issues in subsequent fixtures. Amateur football has now been put on hold by the federal government until at least January, though, so all eyes turn to 14 March 2021 – when the rematch with Holdenstedt is scheduled.', 'By day, David Ayres was an operations manager who had driven the ice resurfacer for a minor league ice hockey team, the Toronto Marlies. He also operated as a practice goalie for their NHL big brothers, the Toronto Maple Leafs, but assumed his chances of a shot at the big time were behind him after undergoing a kidney transplant 15 years ago. Then, in February, the Maple Leafs’ opponents, Carolina Hurricanes, lost both of their netminders to injury during the pair’s meeting. Ayres, watching alongside his wife in the stands while eating a reuben sandwich, was the on-call emergency replacement and found himself pressed into unlikely action at the age of 42 – eventually stopping eight shots in a 6-3 win for Carolina. Ayers became a television star for a short time afterwards and his stick was included in a display at the hockey hall of fame, owing to his new-found status as the first emergency goalie ever to win an ', 'NHL', ' game. Three days after the match, the Hurricanes flew Ayers to Raleigh before they faced the Dallas Stars and gave him a hero’s reception in their locker room.', 'The occasional domestic disagreement is OK when we’re all holed up together for this long. The keys to rubbing along in harmony are a little give, take and mutual understanding. Not forgetting this time-honoured maxim: “Don’t trip and sever the cable when your wife is in the running to win a prestigious virtual triathlon.” Unfortunately Tim O’Donnell did not keep those wise words to heart when his wife Mirinda Carfrae, a former triathlon world champion, was competing in the inaugural Ironman VR Pro Challenge women’s race from their home in Colorado. Carfrae was going great guns during the event in April, which was broadcast live on Facebook, before O’Donnell stumbled and undid all her good work – losing the connection and sending her tumbling off the leaderboard. Scratchy Zoom calls seem the least of anyone’s troubles by comparison. Since then, Carfrae has announced she is expecting her second child, and another potential cable-wrenching hazard.', 'How do you turn disappointment into opportunity during a pandemic? In Mesut Özil’s case you become a microblogger, tweeting your support to the team that no longer requires your £350,000-a-week services and throwing in the occasional passive-aggressive barb. Who might be Leicester’s greatest threat against an unimaginative Arsenal? According to their sidelined playmaker it was “the creative James Maddison”. What about the most underrated player Özil has ever played with? “Matteo Guendouzi – I’m sure he will be a big football player one day!” On Arsène Wenger? “I think many people around ', 'Arsenal', ' are really missing him.” To Piers Morgan, at least one barb regarding infamous telephone-related allegations. Among all this, and several chirpily upbeat commentaries on the club’s games, he offered to pay the salary of Jerry Quy, who wore the famous Gunnersaurus costume for 27 years but was made redundant in October. Whatever one may wonder about Özil’s motivations, he has shown a defter touch on social media than most of his teammates have managed on the pitch since the season began.', 'The schools might have been closed but there was no time for slacking. Gui Khury, an 11-year-old skating boy wonder from Brazil, used his time out of the classroom to an effect that shames the rest of us during the country’s lockdown earlier this year. He took his board out every day and, to widespread astonishment, ', 'became the first person ever to land a 1,080 degree turn', ' – effectively a triple spin – on a vertical ramp. The feat was captured on Instagram and Khury, who turned 12 a week before Christmas, has thrilled his 57,000 followers with a range of manoeuvres ever since. It might not be for the faint-hearted – but it definitely beats double maths.']

The Spins: end-of-year cricket awards for a shambolic 2020:	['S', 'pending a fortnight locked in a quarantine hotel with a 10-month-old, as I learned in Perth this month, can inspire any number of strange decisions.

Sam Allardyce rides again and Arteta’s Arsenal fire at last – Football Weekly:	[]
The Spin: six wishes for cricket in 2021:	['A', 'hhh, midwinter Test matches. For cricket-lovers around the world keeping a sleepy eye on Australia’s showdown with India, there’s nothing quite like the warm feeling of waking up to an Aussie batting collapse. It can be rather ruined when swiftly followed by the icy feeling of waking up to ', 'an Indian batting catastrophe', '. But that makes it all the better when India bounce back to pull off ', 'a famous victory', ' masterminded by a stand-in captain.', 'The last week in December is the peak of the cricket year, even if the only tests involving England this time are of the medical variety. It’s also the moment to look ahead and work out what we would like to see in 2021. So here are The Spin’s wishes, some realistic, others merely hopeful – but then, as the Guardian likes to say, ', 'hope is power', '.', 'Cricket can manage better without fans than many sports – it has had plenty of practice. But an empty ground is still a crying shame, and as the Premier League has shown, even a distanced crowd can drum up an atmosphere. This is one facet of the pandemic where the British government has erred on the side of caution. In hindsight, it would have been perfectly fine to build on ', 'the experiments of midsummer', ', rather than abruptly giving up on them. A couple of thousand people could have safely trickled in to watch each day of England’s matches at the Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford. Let’s hope the relevant minister, Oliver Dowden, noticed that the MCG in Melbourne has just lifted its attendance back up to 30,000, or about one-third capacity.', 'There is plenty of time to iron out the details: England’s home summer is due to begin on 29 June, almost as late as last year, and the first Test is not until 4 August. There’s even time for Dowden to be replaced by someone who actually has a passion for culture and sport. It’s baffling that Boris Johnson has yet to hand the culture brief to Jesse Norman, the financial secretary to the Treasury, who a) writes books, b) plays the trumpet, c) supports Manchester United and d) loves cricket.', 'If you asked a fan to name the world’s top-ranked Test team, they would almost certainly say Australia or India. ', 'The latest ICC rankings', ', issued on 14 December, have Australia top by a whisker. But it’s not India who are breathing down their necks – it’s New Zealand, the quiet achievers of international cricket. By the time their current series are over, any of the three could come out on top. If New Zealand win both their home Tests against Pakistan, it will take a 3-1 win by either Australia or India to keep them from the summit. Cinderella is at the ball: the only question is how long she is staying.', 'It’s a great achievement to make a Test hundred for England, and in 143 years, only 171 men and 21 women have discovered what it feels like. The latest of them is Zak Crawley, aged 22, with that ', 'fabulous innings of 267', ' against Pakistan. As he gazes out from his flat at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury, there’s just one small cloud in the sky. Of the 170 Englishmen to make a Test hundred before him, 60 never added a second.', 'The ', 'One Ton Club', ' includes two players with their name on a stand at Lord’s (Plum Warner and Gubby Allen); several other England captains (Douglas Jardine, George Mann, JWHT Douglas, Tony Lewis); a sprinkling of commentators (Trevor Bailey, David Lloyd, Nick Knight); a man whose first Test hundred was even bigger than Crawley’s (Tip Foster, who made 287 in Sydney ', 'on his Test debut', '); a couple of cult figures (Gilbert Jessop, David Steele); three of Crawley’s recent teammates (Ollie Pope, Chris Woakes and Stuart Broad); another of his fellow tourists this winter (Ben Foakes); and his mentor, Rob Key, who stroked 221 against West Indies at Lord’s but never reached that second fine careless rapture. Crawley hasn’t had much practice making hundreds – the 267 was only his fifth in first-class cricket – but he has the talent and the temperament to stop his magnum opus turning into a millstone.', 'Bowlers need landmarks too. Mark Wood waited nearly four years for ', 'his first England five-fer', ', added ', 'another', ' a year later, and then hit the buffers. His problem hasn’t been bowling badly, it has been getting on the field. Since his blazing breakthrough in St Lucia, Wood has played only three Tests – two in South Africa that went swimmingly and one in Southampton that gave West Indies a measure of revenge. By the end of this year, he was even missing from the white-ball side, squeezed out by the Curran brothers. After spending far too long with the physio, Wood is now having to deal with a different kind of frustration, living in the bubble and carrying the drinks.', 'The Spin is not just concerned because Wood is a great character and a magnificent sight when in full flow. Come next winter’s Ashes, England are going to need all the firepower they can get, assuming Steve Smith remembers how to reach double figures. Of England’s many talented seamers, Wood is the only one who gets dramatically better when he steps on a plane: his average in overseas Tests is under 21, while at home it’s nearly 45. On 11 January, he turns 31. Three days later, all being well, England face Sri Lanka in Galle, and with Jofra Archer resting, Wood’s is the first name we will be looking for on the team sheet.', 'Cricket’s most moving moment in 2020 was when Michael Holding and Ebony Rainford-Brent bared their souls on Sky and talked about facing racism. Coming from Holding, who has been so self-contained as a commentator, it was like the moment when David Attenborough finally spoke out about the state of the climate – his dignity, and seniority, lent even greater weight to his dismay.', 'Holding is writing a book called Why We Kneel, How We Rise. His agent is Charlotte Atyeo, who used to be at Bloomsbury working on Wisden, and his publisher is Ian Marshall of Simon & Schuster, the man behind the Playfair ', 'Cricket', ' Annual. There have been several bestsellers about race, but none of them has homed in on sport. It would be great if Holding changed that.', 'For Ireland’s cricketers, 2020 started promisingly, with nine white-ball games in 10 weeks. Touring West Indies in January, they bounced back from a 3-0 drubbing in the ODIs to draw the T20 series 1-1. As the thwack of leather on willow gave way to stadium gates slamming shut, they squeezed in three T20 games against Afghanistan in India – losing the first two and tying the last after winning the Super Over. When cricket resumed in July, they led the way by touring England. True to form, they lost the first two ODIs before winning the third in style – the first time they had ever beaten England on English soil.', 'Their problem is that as the pandemic drags on, the bigger fish will bend over backwards to face each other and may well forget about the minnows. Ireland should be back in action next week, when they play the first of seven ODIs in UAE – four against their hosts, followed by three against Afghanistan. After that, their diary is as blank as yours or mine. A glance at the ICC’s ', 'timetable of Future Tours', ' from 2018 suggests the pandemic has already cost Ireland five Tests, which is a high price to pay when you have played only three in your history.', '•', ' ', 'This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

Tomas Soucek leaves it late as West Ham stun lacklustre Everton:	['After a punishing schedule and a gruelling spectacle, West Ham finally received their reward. Tomas Soucek’s late winner gave David Moyes his first points at Goodison Park since leaving ', 'Everton', ' eight years ago and the manager responded in kind by giving his weary players four days off.', 'Everton could have gone second with a fifth consecutive ', 'Premier League', ' win but served up a laboured display bereft of ideas. Carlo Ancelotti claimed his side merited a point. He was being extremely kind. They deserved exactly what they got as West Ham defended expertly, grew stronger as the game went on and produced the only creativity on show.', '“Going back to your old clubs is always special,” said Moyes. “I had a brilliant time here. Coming here and winning was really important. Everton are in a great moment and you cannot underestimate what it would mean to go second, and we were on the back of our third game in six days. I cannot praise the players enough. Their fitness levels and professionalism is a great credit to them.”', 'Covid-19 loomed large over the fixture, with Ryan Fredericks self-isolating after a positive test and West Ham preparing to clean out their training ground once again. Moyes said: “We have not been told to do that and it is not because of the one Covid player we have got. It’s because we are trying to do everything we can.”', 'After three matches enriched by the noise of fans, Goodison fell eerily silent once again following the Liverpool city region’s move into tier 3 on Wednesday. It was as depressing for the 2,000 hoping to start the new year by watching their team in the flesh for the first time since March as for those due to attend Monday’s postponed match against Manchester City. Though small, the attendances had played a big part in Everton’s rise up the table and their absence was reflected in a subdued performance. Everton’s players could not find inspiration from within. Ancelotti recalled Richarlison following the Brazilian’s concussion against Manchester United in the Carabao Cup and must have wondered why he bothered. Richarlison was woeful. James Rodríguez also returned as a substitute after missing the past five matches with a calf problem but could not improve a flat attacking display either. So much for the benefit of extra rest after the City postponement.', 'This was West Ham’s third game since Christmas Day but they never appeared at a disadvantage and were on top before Soucek’s late winner. They restricted Everton to playing neat, sharp triangles in harmless areas, stopped all service to Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who looks shattered, and closed down quickly whenever Richarlison, Gylfi Sigurdsson or Bernard received possession. The visitors were forced into a late change of goalkeeper when Lukasz Fabianski felt a recurrence of a thigh injury during the warm-up. His replacement, Darren Randolph, did not have a save to make until the 45th minute.', 'Everton’s first shot on target was a dipping volley from Bernard after a Sigurdsson corner had been cleared into his path but Randolph was equal to the effort. Jordan Pickford’s first save arrived even later, when Aaron Cresswell arched a free-kick towards the far corner following a foul by Ben Godfrey on Vladimir Coufal. Pablo Fornals then squandered an excellent chance to break a tedious stalemate. The midfielder was unmarked when Jarrod Bowen picked him out with a dinked cross into the area but, from only eight yards out, he miscued a header so far wide a teammate’s scream echoed around the stadium.', 'Both managers attempted to inject much-needed creativity and quality by introducing Rodríguez, André Gomes, Andriy Yarmolenko, Manuel Lanzini and Michail Antonio but only Moyes’s changes succeeded. With four minutes remaining, Yarmolenko released Soucek with an intelligent chip. Pickford parried the midfielder’s initial shot on the turn but the rebound fell to Cresswell whose low drive deflected off Yerry Mina and into the path of Soucek, who made no mistake for his fifth goal of the season.']
Frank Lampard backs Chelsea striker Timo Werner to end goal drought:	['Frank Lampard has backed Timo Werner to regain his composure in front of goal and make a positive impact when Chelsea host Manchester City on Sunday. Although Werner had a reputation as one of the best strikers in Europe ', 'when he joined Chelsea last summer', ', he has struggled recently and has gone 12 games without a goal for club and country.', 'The former RB Leipzig forward has looked drained of confidence and, having been substituted at half-time ', 'during last Saturday’s defeat to Arsenal', ', he was dropped for ', 'the draw with Aston Villa', ' two days later. Although Werner’s form has been a concern for Chelsea, who have won one of their past five games, Lampard believes that the 24-year-old’s work on his finishing in training will pay off.', '“Every player goes through tough times in front of goal,” Chelsea’s manager said. “The beauty is that he has been getting chances because that is definitely a positive. I found work on the training ground to be the only way to turn that; simple work and repetition of finishing, which Timo is doing.', '“When you work like that it is a matter of time because his natural attributes will get him in front of goal and away from defenders. If his confidence comes down from missing a couple, that is only natural. It is my job to help him with his confidence. I feel the goals will come.”', 'One of the criticisms of Werner, who has eight goals this season, is that he struggles against deep defences. The German could have more space on the break against City, although Lampard believes the striker’s threat is far from one-dimensional.', '“I think Timo’s attributes can be very powerful on the counterattack but there are lots of things that we need in the game against City, on and off the ball,” he said. “He is always a huge weapon on that and I think he will become a huge weapon against low blocks. Sometimes the onus is on us to get the ball in the right areas.”', 'Lampard added that ', 'Chelsea', ' could look to trim their squad this month. Atlético Madrid are interested in Marcos Alonso, who is out of favour at left-back, but they may only be able to afford a loan.', 'Chelsea will also look to offload one of their five centre-backs. Fikayo Tomori could leave on loan, with Newcastle among a number of clubs interested, unless a buyer is found for Antonio Rüdiger.']
Jürgen Klopp urges Premier League to avoid Covid 'circuit-breaker' shutdown:	['Jürgen Klopp believes the ', 'Premier League', ' should avoid implementing a “circuit-breaker” shutdown designed to control the rising number of Covid-19 cases at clubs if at all possible.', '“I think the competition can go on,” said Liverpool’s manager, presumably mindful of the severe fixture congestion that would be an inevitable consequence of such a suspension. “And it’s also important it goes on. People want to watch it and, in this case, we are not part of society.', '“We go to the training ground and stuff like that but usually we isolate. We try to do everything to keep the boys as safe as possible so I think we really can carry on. We all try to do our best to keep the competition going. I think it works well for everybody but I’m not a [medical] specialist and I will respect all the decisions made in the next few weeks.”', 'The realist in Klopp always expected an increase in coronavirus within clubs at this time of year. “We knew before the winter there would probably be a second wave,” he said. “It’s a challenge when it is about self-isolation so I am not surprised that the numbers have gone up slightly in football.”', 'Klopp has counselled patience regarding Virgil van Dijk’s return from anterior cruciate ligament surgery. The centre-half is in Dubai undergoing rehabilitation work following surgery in October and the club have sent a physiotherapist to the United Arab Emirates to work one-to-one with him.', 'Van Dijk has recently posted videos from his exercise bike in the gym, demonstrating he has reached the milestone of being able to bend his knee again, but Klopp cautioned that a return to playing remains a long-term aim. “Progress is good but there’s still a long way to go. I can be happy when I see these videos because it shows we make good progress but, with this type of injury, it will still take a lot of time. I would like to say something else but these are the facts.”']
Joe Launchbury hopes physicality can power Wasps and bring Lions chance:	['I', 'n a manner entirely in keeping with his character, Joe Launchbury quietly re-established himself as a member of Eddie Jones’s England side during the autumn. He started all four ', 'Autumn Nations Cup', ' matches to mark his longest run in the side for two and a half years and though he is too self-effacing to admit it, showed the kind of form that may finally earn a British & Irish Lions call-up at the third time of asking.', 'He did not catch the eye with the kind of interventions of his second-row partner Maro Itoje but he was no less integral to England’s unbeaten autumn and for all that Jones has spoken of a team in transition, his most recent side featured only two changes from the ', '2019 World Cup final', ' with Launchbury’s re-emergence one of few notable differences.', 'His head coach at ', 'Wasps', ', Lee Blackett, believes Launchbury is “in the form of his career”, now 29 and long since established as the club’s captain. The British & Irish Lions will not want for second rows on their summer tour of South Africa but, according to Blackett, Launchbury “has to be in the reckoning”.', 'Whether Warren Gatland agrees is another matter. Launchbury has been passed over twice before by the New Zealander, suffering from the perception that he is not hard enough around the edges. Gatland is pragmatic enough to change his mind but Launchbury acknowledges the reputation that precedes him has been a difficult one to shake. Ironically enough however, he believes Matt Proudfoot, the South African who masterminded the Springboks’ demolition job on England’s pack in the World Cup final – now one of Jones’s assistants and maybe one of Gatland’s too in summer – has played a key role this year.', '“I have worked really hard on my physicality,” says Launchbury. “In the last six months I have probably seen more of the work we do on the training ground come through on to the pitch. I have really enjoyed that role I have had.', '“It has always been a [perception] on how I conduct myself away from the pitch. Maybe my personality … I like to think I am cool and calm when playing. Maybe that has gone against me, but I would like to think anyone who has spent time working or playing with me, understands where I am on that level. Although I don’t show it in some of the off-the-ball stuff, maybe it is a bit more controlled.', '“Matt Proudfoot has come in with a fresh pair of eyes and views things slightly differently. If you look at the South African style of rugby, you see the front five forwards are very physical and confrontational. That’s the style of rugby they look to play and impose on the opposition. I have taken bits of his background of coaching and his style of play into my game and certainly I have enjoyed that. I would say Matt over the last few months has been a big influence in that regard.”', 'Launchbury swerves the Lions question but is clearly aware that if it is to be third time lucky he will need to keep his place in the England side during the Six Nations. He will be missed by Wasps during the tournament – he always is when off on international duty – but goes with Blackett’s blessing. “This is my sixth season here and this is by far the best I’ve seen him play for us,” says Blackett. “It was exactly the same when he went to England this time around and I was really pleased with what I saw there. Hopefully he’s got a big summer there as well. He’s the best captain I’ve seen, as a player or coach.', '“The next level he’s gone to are the collisions on both sides of the ball. He’s always won gain line with the ball in his hands, but now he’s winning gain line by being really physical in defence. He’s so motivated and his passion for the club is infectious. It’s hard for me not to get emotional when talking about Joe. I think really highly of him and I’d love him to be there in the summer.”', 'Launchbury returns to the Wasps side to face Exeter on Saturday in a repeat of ', 'last season’s Premiership final', ', having had his mandatory two-week break since England’s autumn campaign. He cut a forlorn figure at Twickenham after the narrow defeat by the Chiefs but Wasps, as demonstrated with an impressive away win at Sale last time out, are slowly rekindling the form that took them to the final.', '“It was very gutting and disappointing but that is what playing big finals does,” he says. “We know how hard we’d worked to get there and it was three years since we’d previously been there. With that you get to understand you’re not guaranteed to be back there again and getting to the ', 'Premiership', ' final is a very hard thing to do. Certainly the drive and ambition here from a club point of view is for sure to get back to those situations.”']
Roger Federer had the perfect excuse to walk away in 2020 – but he wants to go on:	['I', 'n July 2018, during times when rooms could still be safely filled with people, Roger Federer was at Wimbledon for a pre-tournament press conference as he prepared to defend his title. For half an hour he fielded questions in three languages from a packed room, but suddenly things took a left turn. An unfamiliar reporter was handed the microphone and without missing a beat, she opened her question with a simple, ', 'direct statement', ': “You look even more handsome than last year.”', 'As onlookers cackled and Federer responded with a timely injection of humour, that cringe-inducing moment felt as if it was a reflection of the way Federer is discussed in general. Even before he marked himself as one of the all-time greats, Federer took on a mythical status in the sporting world. He is the maestro. He is peRFect. He is often described as some otherworldly being. There are those interminable jokes from commentators about his inability to sweat, even when his headband is clearly soaked through. Such a comment from a professional journalist seemed as if it was a natural progression.', 'Detractors of Federer and some neutrals argue there is far too much fawning over him, while his fans would point out that a once-in-a-lifetime talent who has won so much and attracted so many fans to the game is worthy of that adulation. What is clear is that with so much of the focus on his effortless style and bottomless toolbox of shots, it often belies the many other qualities that make him great.', 'On Sunday night, Federer concluded his year by announcing ', 'he will not be competing at the Australian Open', ' in February. After previously undergoing surgery for a torn meniscus in his left knee in 2016, this year Federer had two arthroscopic surgeries on his right knee. He did not recover satisfactorily from the first surgery in February, so he decided on a second attempt in June. He is now working his way back up to full intensity in Dubai and he will eventually decide on his first tournament back.', 'For much of his career, Federer’s evasion of injury has been a pillar of his game, allowing him to preserve his body and remain competitive for so long. Now the reality of being 39 years old with 1,513 ATP singles matches under his belt has arrived.', ' ', 'Federer’s withdrawal means his injury layoff will last longer than a year. His mortality as a professional player has naturally been on his mind. “It is already clear that I am near the end of my career,” he said in July ', 'to the Swiss broadcaster SRF', '. “I can’t tell what’s in two years. That’s why I plan year after year. I’m still happy right now. But when the cogwheels no longer work, I stop.”', 'The most interesting aspect of these final years of Federer’s career has been what he is willing to do to keep those cogwheels turning. It has taken far more than just a wave of his magic wand. Eighteen months ago, he was so close to one of his great achievements, leading Novak Djokovic by double match point ', 'in the Wimbledon final', ' before falling in a fifth-set tie-break.', 'For Federer, memories of that match should also include the 10 months of work it took to return to that spot. After defeats at ', 'Wimbledon', ' and ', 'the US Open in 2018', ', his powers waning, Federer responded by adding more tournaments to his schedule. He spent a long winter with his head down, slowly grinding through uncertain patches of form. There were many ugly matches, balls thrashed in bursts of anger, and he was still searching for his level by the 2019 Australian Open. It was engrossing to see him resolutely work through his issues before he finally soared again.', 'The only sighting of Federer in 2020 came at the Australian Open after a shortened off-season. Despite never really finding his best, he dragged himself into the last four, engineering two breathless five-set escapes against John Millman and Tennys Sandgren. ', 'By the semi-final', ', his body was finished.', 'At any age, recovering from a serious injury is difficult. Surgery is physically painful and mentally draining. Rehabilitation is the height of tedium. The uncertainty of if and when it will be possible to return to competition can be suffocating enough as a 20-year-old, let alone in a brittle body after decades of competition. Since February, Federer will have had to navigate all of those emotions.', 'In that same Wimbledon press conference two and a half years ago, Federer was asked about Serena Williams’s comeback after her pregnancy. He noted his happiness at her decision to take the route back to sport after such a long time away. “Why not?” he said. “After everything she’s done, it would have been the perfect excuse and exit to say: ‘I’ve had it.’”', 'After two knee surgeries and a year away from tennis at 39 years old, 2020 produced the cleanest excuse and exit route for Federer to vanish into the night. Instead, he has not had it. He has been consistent and resolute in his determination to compete at the highest level again. Age eventually comes for us all, but he has impeded its effects by complementing his ability with grit, resolve and an enduring motivation that remains more than 22 years since his first professional match and so long since most of his contemporaries let go. In the end, that feels even more meaningful than his talent alone.']
Karen Carney deletes Twitter account after abuse over Leeds comments:	['Karen Carney has deleted her Twitter account after remarks she made in her role as a TV pundit about Leeds United were ', 'mocked by the club’s official account', ' and led to waves of sexist abuse.', 'Online attacks against the former England international, who played 144 times for her country, are understood to have increased each day since Leeds shared a clip of Carney’s commentary with their 660,000 followers on Tuesday night.', 'With the abuse getting “worse and worse”, according to friends of Carney, and with the majority of it sexist, she chose to delete her account on Friday. She will continue to work on TV and radio this weekend as a Premier League analyst.', 'Carney is hardly the first prominent woman to be forced off social media by cyberbullying. Nor is she the only professional footballer. Last week the Arsenal goalkeeper Rúnar Alex Rúnarsson deleted his Twitter account after a mistake in a ', 'Carabao Cup tie against Manchester City', ' made him a target of his own fans.', 'It is the central role that Leeds have played in this incident, however, that is different and has outraged many within football.', 'Speaking after ', 'Leeds’s 5-0 victory over West Bromwich Albion', ' on Tuesday night, Carney commented on the winning side’s intense playing style and suggested it could cause fatigue over the course of a season. “I actually think they got promoted [last season] because of Covid, in terms of it gave them a bit of respite,” she said.', 'Taking an 18-second clip of Carney’s remarks from the Amazon Prime Video broadcast, Leeds’s social media team then posted it on Twitter. They added the caption: “‘Promoted because of Covid’ Won the league by 10 points”. They also tagged Amazon on their message, but Carney’s face was the central image.', 'The tweet, quickly identified as likely to cause an outpouring of invective in Carney’s direction, was immediately criticised. Fellow women in the game called out Leeds, including Carney’s fellow international Beth England: “Atrocious behaviour by your social platform,” ', 'England wrote', '. “Cyber bullying a female pundit and opening her up to mass online abuse for DOING HER JOB AND HAVING HER OPINION.”', 'Leeds did not delete the tweet. Instead, the club’s owner, Andrea Radrizzani, ', 'endorsed its sentiments', '. “I take the responsibility of the Club tweet,” he wrote on Twitter. “I consider that comment completely unnecessary and disrespectful to our Club and particularly to the fantastic hard work of our players and coaches whom were understanding on the pitch for the last two championship seasons by all stats.”', 'Radrizzani was supported by former Leeds players, and Leeds fans pointed out that Carney was not the first pundit to have been criticised through the club’s social media, with targets in the men’s game including the former Aston Villa player Gabriel Agbonlahor and Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder.', 'The abuse received by Carney was undeniable. In public messages Carney was called a “silly bitch”, a “stupid slag” and “twat of the week” and told to “get back in the kitchen”, or to “put your mic down and get yourself home there’s dishes to wash and clothes to iron”. Other users wrote they were “sick of this shit women pundits”, while another said: “Women’s lives matter but come on, women and football? Get kettle on love!” These were far from the worst examples.', 'On Wednesday afternoon Leeds ', 'released a statement', ' saying they “completely condemned” any abuse directed at Carney and that “everyone at our club respects Karen greatly for what she has achieved in the game”.

:	['A', 't the end of a dark year like no other, and the start of a new one that will complete a decade of his life at Liverpool, Jordan Henderson is in a mood to pause and reflect. The ', 'Liverpool', ' captain has family and friends who work for the NHS on the Covid-19 frontline. Sometimes they have held the phones and tablets which offer the only way for people who are dying to say goodbye to those they love.', 'His father, whom the NHS helped to save during a long battle against cancer, has been shielding and Henderson did not see much of him last year. This helps to explain why he ', 'started and drove the crisis fund', ' that raised millions of pounds from Premier League footballers for the NHS.', 'Having just returned home after a morning of training, amid the blurring end-of-year fixtures, Henderson is engaging company even when addressing the brutal impact of 2020. “I think it has,” he says when asked whether the year has changed him. “It certainly puts things into perspective. Not that I ever take stuff for granted but it reiterates what is important – family and health. That’s all that matters. You’ve got to enjoy life while you can and try not to get too down. But it’s been difficult for everyone because of the virus. Hopefully we can see the other side very soon but a lot of people are struggling, a lot of people have died, and it’s affected us all. All me and the other lads [his fellow club captains who worked on the fund] tried to do was help make a difference.”', 'On the field, despite the absence of fans, ', 'Henderson led Liverpool', ' to their first league title in 30 years. He epitomised the imperious self‑belief and hard-running zeal of the champions. His Player of the Year award, ', 'voted for by the country’s football writers', ', was followed by ', 'second place behind Lewis Hamilton', ' in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year poll.', 'The plaudits have replaced the criticism and doubts which once hounded Henderson. Yet he insists his hunger to improve remains undiluted. He points out that, as Liverpool play Southampton away on Monday night, the same fixture in April 2019 represented a turning point. Henderson rose from the bench and produced a commanding display as Liverpool ', 'recovered from conceding an early goal to win 3-1', '. Their captain, striving to establish himself as a much more attacking presence, proved he could play in the advanced midfield role he craved.', 'Of course, moments of personal crisis seem more fascinating to those of us who did not live through them. But Henderson responds to questions about the adversity he overcame in a way which suggests his emotions are still vivid. In June 2011, when he ', 'joined Liverpool from Sunderland', ' for £20m, he was one of the Fenway Group’s first major signings ', 'following their takeover', '. Fourteen months later, as hard as it is to imagine now when considering Henderson’s importance to the club, Liverpool wanted to sell him to Fulham in a swap deal with Clint Dempsey.', '“That was a difficult moment I remember very clearly,” Henderson says of a time which reduced him to tears. “We were preparing for a [Europa League qualifying] game against Hearts at Anfield. We met as normal in the [Hope Street] hotel and I got a knock on my door saying the manager wanted to speak to us. To be fair to Brendan Rodgers, it was really just a conversation. It was an opportunity [to leave for Fulham] I didn’t want and I didn’t like. I still felt I had an awful lot to give.', '“But I was in a very dark place at that time. It made us a lot stronger and a lot wiser later on and, without that, you never know what could have happened. So I really cherish them moments because you need setbacks, you need adversity. You get back up, and it makes you stronger because you want to prove people wrong. Ever since that day I had something in me. I needed to prove to the manager I would get in his team eventually. I’d do absolutely everything to be in his team, this football club, and I’d prove them wrong. In the end I did.”', 'I needed to keep working, keep getting stronger in the gym, working around the clock, doing things other people weren’t', 'Henderson explains that he and his wife, Rebecca, remained as close as ever during this tumultuous period but that “it was difficult because I didn’t like mixing family with football”. He says: “When I was coming home, back then, I wasn’t in a great mood a lot of the time. I was still very young and learning how to deal with situations like that. But I was so focused on what I needed to do. I needed to keep working, keep getting better, keep getting stronger in the gym, working around the clock, doing things other people weren’t doing, just to be given an opportunity. So, for me, all the focus was on what I love doing – playing football and being the best I can be. Rebecca has always been there for me but, yeah, it was a difficult period.”', 'Steven Gerrard told me, when we worked on ', 'his autobiography', ', that Henderson’s mum even approached him to share her concern. “She was worried for her boy,” Gerrard said. “He was a little lost. The move was initially too big for him.” While he joked about feeling very old because Henderson once had a poster of him on his bedroom wall, Gerrard was convinced the club had found his successor. Stressing that Henderson was one of the Liverpool players “I cared about most”, Gerrard reassured his teammate’s anxious mother.', 'He promised Liz Henderson he would look after her boy but, also, that he had been watching Jordan closely. “I know he’ll be fine,” Gerrard said before emphasising that Henderson would become “a vital player for the club”.', 'Did Henderson share that conviction eight years ago? “I don’t think you ever know what’s going to happen. When I first signed I was very young and I knew it was going to be tough. But I always wanted to test myself and I knew, by going to Liverpool, I would become better. But it took a little time.”', 'Even as a key presence in the team, when Liverpool came so close to winning the league in 2014, Henderson was tested. His father, Brian, had been diagnosed with throat cancer a few months earlier. “It was a shock,” Henderson recalls. “I didn’t see him for at least five months because he didn’t want to see us when he was having treatment. I kept my head down, kept playing, because I knew him watching and us winning could help. So that’s where my energy went and you’d be surprised how quick six months went. My dad was diagnosed towards the back end of January so, when I was playing, I was just so free and doing everything I could to lift him.”', 'Few people knew what Henderson was facing then and he reveals that he spoke often ', 'to Steve Peters', ', the sports psychiatrist. “My dad was ill and when we were close to winning the league I spoke to Steve quite regularly. I also did when he was with England, so I had a good couple of years of talking to Steve. It made a big difference.', '“A lot of people deal with stuff like this and it made us grow up even quicker and I learnt a lot. In a way it made my dad stronger and I feel it changed him for the better. He enjoys living life even more now than he already did. If you get through that you can have a positive outlook but for other people, unfortunately, sometimes it’s not a happy ending.”', 'On the night Henderson lifted the Champions League trophy in June 2019 he and his father ', 'shared a tearful embrace on the pitch', ' which completed a profoundly moving celebration. Apart from his dad surviving cancer, Henderson finally felt accepted at the pinnacle of football. Yet just seven weeks earlier he had been a substitute against Southampton and still battling to move beyond the critics and doubters as he played more as a No 8 than a deeper-lying No 6.', '“That game was a little turning point,” Henderson says. “Even though I performed well before that, I felt that was the start of playing in a slightly different position. I could bring something different to the team and from that point I felt a lot more confident. I performed much better and more consistently.', '“When the manager [Jürgen Klopp] first came [in October 2015] it was difficult for me because I was injured. I kept getting niggles so it took a while to get the real me and my rhythm back. And then I began to play in a deeper role and that is thanks to Jürgen, because I don’t think many people would have seen how I could do that role. There were times when I wasn’t performing well. Then you would question if I was good enough. But I had confidence in the manager and kept working and I matured. I’m really grateful for having that opportunity because my all-round game has improved defensively and offensively.”', 'Was Klopp easily convinced when Henderson asked to play in a more attacking position? “When we signed Fabinho, a natural defensive midfield player, I felt that was a good thing for me because I could play a little higher up. So when I had the conversation with the manager he was very open. But I don’t think he was going to play us there straightaway. Not long afterwards I was on the bench at that Southampton game before I came on as an attacker and managed to score. I’ve matured even more since then. At the end of last year I played more as an 8, but with certain injuries I’ve had this season I’ve played a little deeper again. I feel I can contribute to both positions.”', 'Liverpool return to St Mary’s top of the table and remain favourites to retain the title. “The past few years we’ve proved how good we can be and now it’s about improving, working as hard as possible, wanting more and giving absolutely everything. We’re in a good position but the Premier League can change very quickly. But that hunger and desire will always be there for me and the team.”', 'Against the pandemic’s grim backdrop of rising rates of infection and death, Henderson stresses that the work his cousin, and other friends, do in the NHS continues to occupy his thoughts. “You hear stories all the time of what they’re doing, what they’re going through, and it’s really tough. They just keep going on the frontline, but there will come a time where the effects may be felt further down the line. It’s important we plan for that now and help them as much as possible because some of the stuff they’ve been doing is incredible.', '“People were dying and their families weren’t allowed at the hospital. So you want to be there to hold the iPad or iPhone for them to say goodbye to their family. I found it really tough hearing those stories. People on the frontline see some horrendous sights and so the least we can do is try and support them and help them prepare for what may come when this all stops.”', 'The pandemic has also meant that Henderson did not see much of his father in 2020. “He’s very high-risk and has to be careful. When the [first] lockdown eased a little I got a moment to see him and maybe once or twice after that. It’s not much but my dad’s in good spirits.”', 'Henderson is the figurehead of a Dry January campaign ', 'jointeamzero.com', ' created by the team behind Budweiser Zero, a non-alcoholic beer. “It’s a really good campaign which fits me well because I don’t really drink alcohol,” Henderson says. “In 2020 lots of people, especially during lockdown, turned to alcohol for comfort to try and keep their mind off things. I’ve heard people talk about how they were drinking too much. So let’s all try and complete Dry January and stay focused and healthy and make a good start to the new year.”', 'The last nine and a half years at Liverpool “have flown by” for Henderson and he pauses again only when I ask whether, at the age of 30, he has begun to consider life without football. “I try not to do that.

Pelé's revolutionary status must survive numbers game against Lionel Messi:	['It seems odd looking back now, but Pelé’s 50th birthday was marked with a star-studded ', 'Pelé', ' exhibition match televised live around the world.', 'Before kick-off a giant Pelé cake was wheeled out at San Siro, on top of which Pelé himself appeared, waving and punching the air in priestly white Pelé-robes, while a massed Pelé-choir sang Happy Birthday Dear Pelé. The Pelé Supremacy filled the skies. And that moment the Pelé-shaped universe was a complete and coherent entity.', 'Have you noticed I’m saying Pelé a lot? There is a concept in psychology called semantic satiation, which describes hearing a word so many times it loses any meaning.', 'In the 1960s intense brown-suited social scientists would run experiments where people said the word “window” hundreds of times, recording how long it took before they started to doubt “window” was a word at all, or that windows actually existed.', 'On some basic level, this is what has happened to Pelé. How many times have you heard that combination of sounds? What does it conjure now? A gold shirt. A haircut. Sun-bleached Mexican grass. A way of running. A man in a white suit waving at people inside a baseball stadium.', 'Over time that Pelé persona has become fixed, an exhibit in the increasingly distant museum of 20th-century pop iconography – Ronald McDonald, Darth Vader, the Empire State Building, Pelé.', 'Pelé was even voted the most famous person in the world in 1970. In a great twist he ended up hanging out with Andy Warhol, the laureate of fame-based inanity, who must have loved Pelé’s opaque, irony-free sense of his own status. The arch piss-taker, Warhol predicted Pelé would have “15 centuries” of fame (“I’m breaking my usual rule”).', 'True to form Pelé was duly in the news again this week, albeit in a way that inspires some protective feelings. In Christmas week Lionel Messi ', 'scored his 644th goal for Barcelona', ' – a total that, it is claimed, surpasses Pelé’s previous record tally for Santos.', 'But wait! Five days later Santos hit back. Cancel the giant cake – in the opinion of Santos, Pelé’s total stands at 1,091, adjusted to include goals scored in one-off games during the tours of the 1960s.', 'It is of course unsurprising this has become an object of dispute. The Pelé industrial complex has a multimillion-dollar turnover. Big Pelé will always protect its interests.', 'On the other hand, for those young enough to have no stake in this cobwebbed old JFK, football’s own Best of the Beatles, there is a natural urge to swish these grandees out of the way, to take your own stake in history. Being cheeked by Messi fans on the internet is probably a fitting end for all our heroes. Kings, pharaohs, Fifa icons. In the end we’re all just a meme.', "The fear is Pelé will be unduly downgraded, that a 'culture war' dynamic must intrude, and something valuable gets lost", 'There is something else here, though. The fear is that Pelé will be unduly downgraded, that a “culture war” dynamic must intrude, and something valuable gets lost in the process.', 'There was a tremor of this when ', 'Diego Maradona died', ' in November. Because two things can’t both be good, because we loved Maradona for his rebel heart, there was some reflex snark at Pelé – an unconnected figure, but the most convenient point of comparison in the zero-sum morality game; and an easy target for his corporate persona, his buddying up to Fifa.', 'Maradona played up to this in his lifetime, mocking Pelé as a boss’s man and accusing him of not glorifying football. For all his brilliance it is also important to remember Maradona talked a lot of shit. Pelé didn’t dope, cheat, shoot people or hang out with murderers. So there is always that when it comes to the glorifying side.', 'Mocking Pelé’s goal record, suggesting his success was some kind of boomer conspiracy is a funnier version of this. But there are a couple of things that deserve to survive the process.', 'First, for all the corporate schmaltz, the actual Pelé is a true wildflower, and a genuinely revolutionary figure. Comparisons are usually pointless, but they can also be interesting. Next to Pelé, Messi and his generation are hothouse blooms, processed through a world where every surface, every moment in time is managed and regulated.', 'Lionel Messi', ' is a supernatural talent fully realised. He’s a true sporting genius. But the fact remains, there has never been a better time to be a genius at football. The conditions are perfect, the temperature just right. Messi was, in many ways, inevitable.', 'Whereas Pelé did not have to exist. He was born as Brazilian sport was still struggling to overcome the colour bar. He played barefoot. He worked as a shoe-shiner and a vendor of stolen peanuts.', 'With nothing but talent to guide him, the boy from Minas Gerais became the first black global sporting superstar, and a source of genuine uplift and inspiration. Pelé won the World Cup aged 17, moving like someone from the future, seeing different things, running through a different kind of air.', 'The idea he did this while somehow having it easy compared to the captive princelings of modern elite-tier football is just silly. But it is also self-defeating. The fact remains those Santos friendlies were what much of the Champions League is now, a treadmill, a way of monetising talent by showing it to the world.', 'Is it harder to score a hat-trick against Atlético Madrid in a tour game in 1966, or against Viktoria Plzen in a hometown semi-dead rubber in 2011? Who knows. But they both definitely involve scoring a hat-trick.', 'What is certain is that Pelé invented this game, the idea of individual global sporting superstardom, and in a way that is unrepeatable now. Forget the giant cakes, the solid silver sombreros, the urge to sweep these icons aside. That part of him, core Pelé, is a gift to all of us. It will remain untouchable.']
Tottenham condemn three players for Christmas party Covid rules breach:	['José Mourinho has made his disappointment clear to three of his Tottenham players after they attended a party over the Christmas period in clear breach of strict tier 4 coronavirus regulations.', 'A photograph that has circulated on social media shows Erik Lamela, Giovani Lo Celso and Sergio Reguilón – together with West Ham’s Manuel Lanzini – at the get-together. There are 15 adults in the shot, which is believed to have been taken on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.', 'West Ham are deeply unhappy with Lanzini, who came on as a substitute in their 1-0 win at Everton on Friday. They say the midfielder has tested negative for Covid since the picture was taken.', 'Lamela was not in the Spurs squad for ', 'their 3-0 win over Leeds ', 'on Saturday despite having featured as a substitute in the past two matches – his first involvement after a near two-month injury lay-off – while Mourinho left Reguilon as an unused substitute. Lo Celso is out with a hamstring injury.', 'Mourinho had said he bought Reguilon a special Christmas dinner as he believed the Spaniard, who signed from Real Madrid in September, would be alone. “An amazing gift, an amazing gift,” he said. “Portuguese piglet, which is amazing for Portuguese and Spanish [people]. So I gave him this because I was told he was going to spend Christmas on his own.', '“He was not alone as you could see and we, as a club, feel disappointed because we give the players all the education, all the conditions. We are not happy, it was a negative surprise for us.”', 'Mourinho was asked whether he was angry and felt let down by the three players. “I prefer to say disappointed. We know what we are internally … we don’t need to open the door to you and let you know what is going on internally, what are going to be the consequences, how did we approach that negative surprise.”', 'A Spurs spokesperson said: “We are extremely disappointed and strongly condemn this image showing some of our players with family and friends together at Christmas particularly as we know the sacrifices everybody around the country made to stay safe over the festive period.', '“The rules are clear, there are no exceptions, and we regularly remind all our players and staff about the latest protocols and their responsibilities to adhere and set an example. The matter will be dealt with internally.”', 'West Ham said: “The club has set the highest possible standards with its protocols and measures relating to Covid-19 so we are disappointed to learn of Manuel Lanzini’s actions. The matter has been dealt with internally and Manuel has been strongly reminded of his responsibilities.”', 'Lanzini apologised on Twitter for making a “bad mistake over Christmas”, adding: “I take full responsibility for my actions. I know people have made difficult sacrifices to stay safe and I should be setting a better example.”', 'It is not the first time Spurs players have broken lockdown rules as there were several incidents during the first lockdown in the spring. ', 'José Mourinho was seen holding a personal training session', ' with Tanguy Ndombele while Ryan Sessegnon and Davinson Sánchez were seen out running together. Serge Aurier was a repeat offender, ', 'having a haircut ', 'and a personal training session with Moussa Sissoko.']

How should I treat insect bites in Australia? Do home remedies work?:	['It’s the holidays and we’re spending more time outdoors. This means we’re exposed to the more annoying and painful aspects of summer – insect bites and stings.', 'There are plenty of products at the local pharmacy to treat these. Some treat the initial bite or sting, others the itchy aftermath.', 'What about natural remedies? Few studies have actually examined them. But if they work for you, and don’t irritate already inflamed skin, there’s likely to be no harm in continuing.', 'When insects bite and sting, they are either defending themselves or need something from us (like blood).', 'Whatever the motivation, it can leave us with a painful or itchy reaction, sometimes a severe allergic reaction, or even a debilitating disease.', 'While insects sometimes get a bad rap, there are relatively few that actually pose a serious threat to our health.', 'Flies and mosquitoes', 'Many types of flies, especially mosquitoes, bite. In most instances, they need blood for nutrition or the development of eggs. The method of “biting” can vary between the different types of flies. While mosquitoes inject a needle-like tube to suck our blood, others chew or rasp away at our skin.', 'While researchers have studied what happens when ', 'mosquitoes bite', ', there is still much to learn about how to treat the bites.', 'So, avoiding mosquito bites is especially important given that some can ', 'transmit pathogens that make us sick', '. We still have lots to learn about treating mosquito bites.', 'Fleas, lice, mites and ticks', 'There are lots of other insects (such as bed bugs, fleas and lice) and other arthropods (such as mites and ticks) ', 'that bite', '.', 'But it is difficult to determine which insect has bitten us ', 'based on the bite reaction alone', '. This is generally because different people react in different ways to the ', 'saliva injected', ' as they start to suck our blood.', 'Bees, wasps and ants', 'Then there are stinging insects, such as bees, wasps and ants. These are typically just defending themselves.', 'But, as well as being painful, the venom they inject when they sting can cause ', 'potentially severe allergic reactions', '.', 'If you suffer potentially severe allergic reactions from ', 'bites or stings', ', immediately seek appropriate medical treatment. For many other people, it is the initial painful reaction and itchy aftermath that require attention.', 'Despite how common insect bites can be, there is ', 'surprisingly little formal research', ' into how best to treat them. Most of the research is focused on insect-borne diseases.', 'Even for recommended treatments, ', 'there is little evidence', ' they actually work. Instead, recommendations are based on expert opinion and clinical experience.', 'Health authorities promote ', 'some general advice', ' on treating insect bites and stings. This includes using pain relief medication (such as paracetamol or ibuprofen). They also advise applying a cold compress (such as a cold pack, ice or a damp cloth soaked in cold water) to the site of the sting or bite to help reduce the inflammation and to ease discomfort.', 'There is also specific advice for ', 'dealing with stings', ' and removing ', 'ticks', '.', 'If you do nothing, the discomfort of the bite or sting will eventually fade after a few days. The body quickly recovers, just as it would for a cut or bruise.', 'If you’re still in pain for more than a couple of days, or there are signs of an allergic reaction, seek medical assistance.', 'Once the initial pain has started to fade, the itch starts. That’s because the body is reacting to the ', 'saliva injected', ' when insects bite.', 'For many people, this is incredibly frustrating and it is all too easy to get trapped in a cycle of itching and scratching.', 'In some cases, medications, such as ', 'corticosteroid', ' creams or ', 'antihistamines', ' could help alleviate the itchiness. You can buy these from the pharmacy.', 'Then there’s ', 'calamine lotion', ', a mainstay in many Australian homes used to treat the itchiness caused by insect bites. But there are ', 'few studies', ' that demonstrate it works.', 'If you’re looking for a home remedy to treat insect bites and the itchiness that comes with it, a quick internet search will keep you busy for days.', 'Potential home remedies', ' include: tea bags, banana, tea tree or other essential oils, a paste of baking soda, vinegar, aloe vera, oatmeal, honey and even onion.', 'There is little evidence any of these work. But not many have actually been scientifically evaluated.', 'Tea tree oil is one of the few. While it is said to help ', 'treat skin reactions', ', the oil itself can cause skin reactions ', 'if not used as directed', '.', 'If a home remedy works for you, and it’s not causing additional irritation, there’s no harm in using it if you’re getting some relief.', 'With so much uncertainty about how to treat insect bites and stings, perhaps it is best if we avoid exposure in the first place. There are ', 'plenty of insect repellents', ' available at your local pharmacy or supermarket that do this safely and effectively.', 'Cameron Webb', ' is a clinical associate professor and principal hospital scientist at University of Sydney.

Victoria announced a “humongous” new battery for Geelong, a huge housing energy efficiency program and development of six renewable zones. Queensland committed to developing three new zones and appointed a minister for renewables and hydrogen.', 'Refreshingly, Australia’s conservative media have largely bitten their collective tongues.

In 2009 Kevin Rudd’s government extended the Howard era renewable energy target (RET) to a nominal “20% by 2020”. Worried that the RET would be too successful, Tony Abbott took an axe to the scheme in 2015, cutting about 40% of the remaining demand. Despite years of sustained attacks, and thanks to states, corporates and literally millions of households and their solar panels, we’ve blown past Rudd’s target. In 2020 more than 26% of energy in the national electricity market (NEM) was delivered by renewables.', '2020 marked the lowest coal use in the NEM this century and the lowest gas usage since 2006 — so much for the “gas led recovery”.

In a marked turnaround, over the last half-year South Australia recorded the lowest wholesale energy prices in the country.', 'Despite dire warnings from (inexpert) pundits, record heat and fire-related transmission outages, our grid performed exceptionally well over summer. A freak storm at the end of January knocked out a major power line between Victoria and SA. Thanks to new levels of preparation and conservatism in the wake of the 2016 blackout, this time SA didn’t skip a beat, and ran “islanded” from the NEM for 17 days straight.', 'Sadly, Audrey Zibelman, CEO of Aemo, the electricity market operator and system planner, returned to the US. Zibelman leaves behind a transformed organisation, no longer struggling with the pace of change, but one approaching the transition with the rigour required to manage such a critical service.', 'One of Zibelman’s crowning achievements at Aemo is the integrated system plan, one of the most detailed network planning processes globally.

The emergence of centre-right advocacy group Coalition for Conservation and thinktank the Blueprint Institute have emboldened MPs acutely aware the party’s position is untenable.', 'Credit where credit is due, the government dropped plans to apply Kyoto carbon credits against our Paris agreement commitments and re-committed to funding clean energy research and development, including for the nascent hydrogen industry. But after seven years in government, the federal government still has no credible emissions reduction plan, so it was no surprise that when UK prime minister Boris Johnson held the Climate Ambition Summit in December, Morrison was denied a speaking slot.', 'For all his failings, Morrison knows how to read the room. His many “micro-pivots” indicate that he knows coal’s best days are behind us, that his advisors over-egged the promise of gas, that renewable energy is extremely popular and climate science denial a major turn-off.', 'Watch Morrison gradually reposition on climate in 2021, just as Howard did before the 2007 federal election, and for the same reasons. The need for economic stimulus provides Morrison with the perfect opportunity to complete his slow pivot and the conservative media appear ready to give him the requisite leeway.', 'In the meantime, Australia’s energy transition continues to play out between the states, business and households.', 'Veteran environmentalist Bill McKibben makes the point that, on climate action, winning slowly is the same as losing.

Covid world map: which countries have the most coronavirus cases and deaths?:	['Since first being recorded late last year in China, the Covid-19 coronavirus has spread around the world, and been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. However, differences in testing mean that the number of cases may be understated for some countries.', 'Obviously, larger countries tend to have higher numbers both of cases and of deaths. But there are many other factors in play, such as the demographic profiles of the countries; countries with ageing populations may be hit harder because the disease is more dangerous to older people.', 'The number of deaths is a more dependable indicator. The disease has hit certain countries, including the US, Brazil, India, Mexico and the UK with particular cruelty.', 'Johns Hopkins University publishes cases and deaths data for most countries in the world (a notable exception being North Korea, which claims to have had none). But JHU concedes that it collects data from many sources, some of which disagree with each other. Even where the collection is less contentious there are significant differences in the ways countries test, and in the way they report cases and deaths. Belgium, for instance, attributes deaths to Covid-19 if the disease is a suspected cause, even if no test has been carried out.', 'Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

', 'NEU members who are penalised by their headteachers for refusing to work on school premises can rely on the union for support with any legal action, Courtney said. “We realise that this late notice is a huge inconvenience for parents and for headteachers. The fault, however, is of the government’s own making and is a result of their inability to understand data, their indecisiveness and their reckless approach to their central duty to safeguard public health,” he said.', '“We do want schools to be open safely as soon as possible.

What difference will Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine make in UK?:	['The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is central to the government’s plans for ending social distancing in the UK and returning to some sort of normality. It has invested in seven different vaccines, but the biggest order is for 100m doses of the AstraZeneca jab, most of which will be manufactured in the UK. While the prime minister was jubilant that the UK was first in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, he is now able to claim a British triumph. More to the point is the ease of use of the ', 'AstraZeneca', ' vaccine. Unlike Pfizer’s, it does not have to be kept in the long term at -70C. Pfizer’s vaccine can be stored in a fridge for five days, but AstraZeneca’s can be kept for months at fridge temperature, which is 2-8C and will be easy to take to care homes to administer to residents, the first priority group for vaccination.', 'That depends on a few things, such as where you are in the priority list set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), how many people can be recruited to carry out vaccination and how fast the vaccinating teams can work.', 'The first priority group is care home residents and the staff who look after them and second is the over-80s and NHS staff. Then it goes by decreasing age: the over-75s, over-70s and over-65s. Next are people of any age with underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk, then the over-60s, over-55s and over-50s.', 'This list makes up more than 25 million people. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, aspires to 2 million people a week being vaccinated, but that’s a big step up from the numbers so far. Even with the AstraZeneca vaccine being easier to deploy and local pharmacists and people with medical training who are not nurses joining vaccination teams, it will be a push. But if all went incredibly smoothly, most people in the first phase could theoretically have had their first shot by April.', 'The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which granted temporary emergency approval of the vaccines, has said in its authorisation that the second dose of Pfizer’s jab should be given at least three weeks after the first, and the AstraZeneca vaccine at least four weeks after. That is in line with what was done in the clinical trials. But the JCVI has gone further in the interest of getting some protection for as many people as possible, saying the second dose can be delayed ', 'up to 12 weeks', ' after the first for both vaccines.', 'There is evidence from Oxford/AstraZeneca’s trials of greater efficacy among people who were given the second shot later – of 70% up to 12 weeks after the first. The JCVI says there is also evidence that is not in the public domain. Pfizer/BioNTech, however, have said in a statement that there is no evidence for the efficacy of a single shot of their vaccine beyond three weeks.', 'It seems clear that the JCVI recommendation is a piece of public health pragmatism. The more people who have some immunity, the less illness there is likely to be.', 'No. It’s possible you may still get 70% protection beyond 12 weeks with the AstraZeneca vaccine – but the booster was always intended to be needed to lengthen the time that protection lasts.', 'That may depend on the arrival of batches of vaccine. Hopefully by the time most people need a second shot, there will be a smooth delivery system in place and no issues around supply. But at the moment, the stocks of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are running short, especially in Europe where it is the only licensed vaccine. BioNTech has warned of a gap in deliveries because it cannot keep up with demand. Some regions of Germany, where the company is based, are having to pause their vaccination programmes until they get more stocks.', 'A trial is planned in the UK to assess whether people could be given one dose of the Pfizer jab and one of AstraZeneca’s – in whatever order. Scientists would say that you should run a trial and not do it without the evidence. However, the Green Book, which is the NHS handbook for staff on how to use vaccinations, has already been updated to say that if none of the first vaccine a person was given is available, they could be given a dose of the other. Although “every effort should be made to determine which vaccine the individual received and to complete with the same vaccine”. It says: “For individuals who started the schedule and who attend for vaccination at a site where the same vaccine is not available, or if the first product received is unknown, it is reasonable to offer one dose of the locally available product to complete the schedule.”']

As blood started to flow, the healer rubbed a concoction of herbs into the incisions and gave me a potion to drink. He took alligator pepper and rubbed it on various parts of my body. There was a rooster, into which he cast the “demon” inside me. The rooster was slaughtered and thrown into the river, supposedly taking my sexuality with it.', 'In boarding school, I met a boy who I would say was my first love. We talked about everything and liked to take long walks. But he struggled. I watched him struggle to accept his sexuality. He felt there was something wrong with him but I didn’t know how to help him. For me it was different. It wasn’t just about sexuality; it was also about gender. I was born male but I have never felt like a man.', 'When I was 22, in university, I met a transgender woman. She was a lot more open, more cosmopolitan, more upfront about what she wanted.

They said I was bringing shame to the family. They took me to a Catholic priest to cast away the stubborn spirit that made me different. The priest told me that God had intended a great path for me, but some negative force had diverted me from it. He made me believe I could change. For a year, I fasted, I went to mass and took communion. I recited all the prayers as though my life depended on it. And it felt as if it did, you see, with the way everyone treated me.', 'But I was all right. I always was. The main issue with conversion therapy is that victims don’t talk about it. It tends to make something that is so wrong look right. The worst part is when they are able to convince you that change can happen, that there is indeed something wrong with you, that you are a mistake of nature, an anomaly. It messes you up.

We need to openly talk about the devastating impact of conversion therapy. I have contemplated suicide several times. I attempted it once; relieved that it failed. ', 'I’ve noticed that when people have a personal experience –– they find out their partner or friend or child is LGBTQ+ –– they become less aggressive. I think my mother always knew, even as she went through the motions of trying to convert me. At some point she realised it wasn’t something she could struggle against.

The mystery epidemic striking Nicaragua’s sugar cane workers – a photo essay:	['F', 'or decades, ', 'a mystery epidemic', ' has plagued young male labourers toiling in Nicaragua’s sugar cane plantations.

Research has shown that basic workplace improvements, such as regular access to water, rest and shade, can significantly decrease potential kidney injury among labourers.', 'For the 2,500 field workers at Nicaragua’s largest and oldest sugar mill, Ingenio San Antonio (ISA), this is welcome news. Just five years ago, ISA was among a number of mills donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to research non-work related causes of CKD.

In Nicaragua, while other factors such as metals, pesticides or toxins may still contribute to CKDu, “the most affected workers are those that work in very hot climates and at the same time have an enormous physical workload,” says Dr Catharina Wesseling, an epidemiologist based at the Karolinska Institute of Sweden.', 'Sugar cane workers have their temperatures taken; bottom left, a worker has a heart rate monitor fitted and, bottom right, a temperature gauge sits in a sugar cane field', '“You can see sugar cane workers as a sentinel population. They are working in the hottest climates and conditions possible and at the same time their energy expenditure is comparable to half marathon runners … or to [those engaged] in military operations, only they do [this work] every day,” says Wesseling.', '“So the combination of those two factors causes an excessive exposure to external and internal heat, and that causes dehydration and alterations of the whole renal system, and leads, in the end, to chronic kidney disease.”', 'Workers cutting in burned fields wear dust monitors on their chests', 'The men working on ISA’s plantations used to chop as many as 7 tonnes of cane each day for seven days a week, labouring up to 14-hours a day in 38C (100.4F) heat with few, if any, breaks.

Yet what is deemed “sufficient” and what else might be “consider[ed] occupational risk such as heat stress and long working hours” must be determined by the mills themselves, says Bonsucro’s Latin America director Miguel Hernández. Over time, it may become a requirement that workers follow a specific rest schedule, dependent on the initiative’s findings, he added.', 'The Adelante research is being logged into a database and shared with other mills and will eventually be rolled out to other countries such as Mexico and Costa Rica, say Hernández and Glaser. There is then potential that the findings could be used to improve working conditions in entirely different sectors, says Glaser, such as construction, mining and brickmaking.', 'Maritza Zapata Gonzalez at her son Walter’s grave at Guadalupe cemetery.

While oxygen tanks were available at the hospital, ventilators to treat the most serious cases of Covid-19 remained scarce. “If a patient needs to be intubated, we will have to watch the patient suffer because we can’t do anything. Eventually they will die,” Dr Xilwo Daud, who supervised the ward, told me at the time.', 'With 60 cases already confirmed among the staff at De Martini hospital, all staff were housed on the premises to minimise the risk of spreading the virus.

‘It has hit my dignity’: women fight for equal treatment from Indian army:	['N', 'idhi Rao* has 13 years’ experience serving in the communications wing of the Indian army.

Unlike men, they were not offered a permanent job. Later, the initial commission period was changed to 10 years, which could be extended a further four years.', 'While men retired with pensions and other benefits, women could never reach the pensionable service length of 20 years, and remained out of the senior ranks.', 'In 2010, after a ', 'group of female officers took their case to court', ', a ruling was made to put women on a par with men, but the Indian government challenged the order and refused to implement it. After a decade-long legal battle, in February last year India’s supreme court ', 'ruled the situation discriminatory', ' and granted the women permanent status and entitlement to army pensions.', 'The authorities set up a board, dividing women into categories. Those with 14 or more years’ service were given either a permanent commission (PC) or the option to retire with a pension. Those with 10-14 years’ service were selected for a permanent position or released from the army without a pension.', 'In November, the army declared that ', '422 women out of 615', ' had been picked for permanent jobs. Rao was not among them. She says there were 68 such women from her service bracket who would be leaving without a pension.', '“Most of us are past our mid-30s and are married and have children.

Who will hire us? Where do we go?”', 'Anjali Sinha*, another affected soldier, says: “When I was pregnant, they asked me to run 5km and I did. When I gave birth, I rejoined within a week for fear of being relegated. I have worked in some of the most difficult terrains of the country, all while dealing with an unsupportive husband and family. And all this for what?”', 'Sinha is in the 11th year of her service.

Pakistan's #MeToo movement hangs in the balance over celebrity case:	['It takes a lot to rattle Leena Ghani. As an artist turned activist helping to raise the voices of Pakistan’s women, she has often fielded abuse, threats and harassment.', 'But when she learned, on a morning in late September, that police had charged her for criminal defamation, linked to Pakistan’s most high-profile #MeToo case, Ghani says she was shaken. “In terms of silencing and demonising people speaking out against sexual assault, it was a new low even for ', 'Pakistan', ',” she says.', 'Ghani was not alone. Eight others were also named in the case, facing three years in jail for criminal defamation. Some only learned of their involvement through a ', 'newspaper article', '.', 'Lawyers say the case has exposed how cyber defamation laws passed under the guise of protecting women from online harassment are being used instead to silence Pakistan’s victims of sexual assault.', 'On ', '16 December', ', the authorities said there was enough evidence to take Ghani and others to trial – and the future of Pakistan’s #MeToo movement now hangs in the balance.', 'That movement began in April 2018 after Meesha Shafi, a singer and actor who starred in The Reluctant Fundamentalist, sent out a tweet alleging sexual harassment.', 'Shafi alleged that she had “been subjected, on more than one occasion, to sexual harassment of a physical nature” at the hands of one of Pakistan’s most beloved celebrities, Ali Zafar. Shafi wrote that by speaking out, she hoped to “break the culture of silence that permeates through our society”.', 'Zafar ', 'denies', ' “any and all claims of harassment lodged against me by Ms Shafi”, and so far has successfully defeated the sexual harassment claims she brought against him in court.', 'The allegations reverberated through Pakistan’s deeply conservative Islamic society, where women speaking out against assault is rare and taboo. Because of Zafar’s popularity disbelief was rife, but dozens of women and men came out in support of Shafi on social media, including several who alleged assault by Zafar.', 'Among them was Ghani, who said her concerns about Zafar’s treatment of women emerged after they became friends in 2014. Writing on Twitter, Ghani accused Zafar of behaviour towards her that “displays a clear lack of respect for women”, including “inappropriate contact, groping, sexual comments”.', '“You hide from him,” read Ghani’s post, “hoping his sleazy eyes and hands don’t find you again. His hands don’t make their way up and down your waist or hold you too tight while you desperately try to wriggle and run.”', 'Similar accusations followed. Blogger Humna Raza alleged that Zafar had groped her at an event, while Maham Javaid, a journalist, recounted on Twitter an alleged incident where Zafar had “tried to kiss my cousin and pull my cousin into a restroom with him. Luckily, my cousin’s friends were there to push him off.”', 'Zafar has accused Shafi of organising a social media campaign against him. According to newspaper reports, he said he could not believe that “anyone can come forward and accuse someone who is innocent and decent, has worked hard for over two decades – solely on social media”.', 'Zafar filed a civil defamation lawsuit against Shafi, seeking a billion rupees in damages. The court accepted the lawsuit and placed a gag order on Shafi, which still prevents her from discussing the allegations in public.', 'Over the next two and a half years, Zafar appeared on a dozen television shows to defend his name, sometimes breaking down into tears and occasionally accompanied by his wife. He alleged the accusations were a smear campaign, coordinated by a group of women who created fake accounts and were funded by foreign money. Last month, Pakistan’s president awarded Zafar the Pride of Pakistan, one of the country’s highest honours.', 'In July 2018, Shafi also began legal proceedings, attempting to take Zafar to court for sexual harassment in the workplace. Her case was dismissed on the technicality that freelancers were not covered by the law. An appeal to the Lahore high court was unsuccessful and although her lawyers have challenged the ruling in the supreme court, the case has still not been heard.', 'In November 2018 rumours began to swirl that Zafar had also filed criminal charges against Shafi and 25 of her online supporters and fellow accusers with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Pakistan’s most powerful investigating body.', 'By July 2019, dozens of people, mainly women, who had written social media posts either making allegations about Zafar or expressing support for Shafi, began to receive notices to appear before the FIA for questioning.', 'Ghani, Javaid and Raza were among them, as well as Iffat Omar, an actor who knew Shafi and Zafar personally. When Zafar claimed on television that the women taking Shafi’s side were being paid by the west to spread propaganda, Omar wrote “stop lying harasser” on her social media.', 'Omar and Ghani were questioned by the FIA and both separately alleged they had been put under pressure by officers to retract their allegations against Zafar and apologise. Both refused. The senior FIA officer on the case was later ', 'suspended', ' over a tweet which led to accusations he was being “Ali Zafar’s personal spokesperson” on social media. The FIA declined to comment on the case.', 'At least three of the women also allege that Zafar applied “indirect harassment” through social networks. Omar says she received a “clear message from Ali Zafar that if I just apologise, everything will be better for me – and I have given him the direct answer that it is not happening.”', 'Ghani alleges that “Zafar also tried to get to me through my family and would send cruel messages about my family’s problems through third parties. A lot of dirty tactics. He was trying to put pressure on me to apologise and I’ll admit it was scary.”', 'But in late 2019, after she had filed a legal petition against Zafar and the FIA for harassment and Javaid had written to the senate human rights committee to complain, everything went quiet. Until September 2020, when news of the charges broke.', 'Nine people, five women including Shafi, Ghani, Omar, Javaid and Raza, and four men, had been booked for defamation by the FIA’s cybercrime wing over the alleged social media “character assassination” of Zafar. The charges carried a three-year jail sentence.', 'There was confusion as to why only nine had been booked in the case, when the original list had 25 names. But then, says Javaid, the penny dropped: “We realised we were the only ones who had refused to apologise to Zafar.”', 'One of the accused, journalist Haseem uz Zaman, is facing charges for tweets that claimed “Ali Zafar harasses women”. They refuse to apologise. “That would not only harm my future and my journalistic credibility, but it would also harm every other survivor of sexual harassment who comes forward in the future,” they say. “And I could not live with that.”', 'After news of the criminal charges broke, Ghani and the others began to face a barrage of online rape and death threats and harassment, and say they were vilified in Pakistani media.', 'A week later, the blogger Raza created a new Twitter account and published a handwritten note retracting her allegations against Zafar and apologising for “the hurt” she had caused him and his family. Zafar shared the tweet. Raza’s name has been dropped from the case.', 'For the women, most galling of all was the law they had been charged under. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act was passed in 2016 partly to protect women from online harassment, but the wing of the FIA tasked with prosecuting these cases is accused of being ineffective.', 'Nighat Dad, Shafi’s lawyer, says she knows dozens of women who have complained to the FIA about online abuse, hate-speech, rape threats and vindictive sharing of intimate videos, but had received no response.', '“It’s rare the cybercrime wing will register cases lodged by women activists, and even if they do, it usually takes years for anything to happen,” says Dad. “So I was never expecting that they would be so shameless as to take action against women survivors who are speaking up.”', 'This was not an isolated use of the law against women. When girls at the prestigious Lahore Grammar School recently alleged harassment by teachers and fellow students, several were threatened with criminal defamation, after which the accusations went quiet. At Lahore University of Management Sciences, a Facebook page for student testimonials of sexual assault was shut down with a letter threatening to report them to the FIA.', '“We are seeing this happen over and over,” says Dad. “The cyber laws that were enacted in the name of protecting women in Pakistan now are being misused and weaponised to silence them.”', 'As Shafi’s lawyer, Dad claims she herself has been subjected to a “vicious smear campaign”, with newspapers making ', 'allegations', ' that she is a foreign operative running an “illegal NGO”, ', 'unsubstantiated claims', ' ', 'retweeted by Zafar', '. “They will not only try and silence victims, but anyone who tries to help victims fight for justice,” says Dad.', 'On ', '15 December', ', the FIA presented evidence that Shafi and others in the case were “guilty” of defamation and asked for court proceedings against them to begin.', 'Ambreen Qureshi, Zafar’s lawyer, declined to talk to the Guardian about the allegations but said “we have presented evidence to the FIA on account of which Ms Shafi and eight others are booked”. Qureshi says Shafi had failed to provide any witnesses to support her allegations. Shafi’s lawyers say she was not given the opportunity.', 'According to Qureshi, the court documents so far show “in this case an innocent man was made a target of a criminally motivated malicious campaign by a group of closely related women.” The eight women facing charges deny any previous relationship or any campaign and say they intend to fight the case in court and push for the cyber defamation law to be repealed.', 'Ghani says: “People keep saying #MeToo is dying in Pakistan, which is so terrible because it’s not like women are not getting harassed and assaulted and raped, but we are being silenced. We all realise that Pakistan’s ', '#MeToo movement', ' hinges on this case.”', '“The whole system is against us; Ali Zafar is a powerful man, and going to court is hard – but what can be harder than lying and living with that lie,” she adds. “I would rather go to jail.”', 'Sign up for the Global Dispatch newsletter – a fortnightly roundup of our top stories, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues:']
