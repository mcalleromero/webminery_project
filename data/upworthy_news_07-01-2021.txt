Psychologist's 'Ring Theory' can help you not say the wrong thing to people in grief:	["It's hard to know what to say when someone you know is going through a crisis. Whether a person has lost a loved one, received a dire medical diagnosis, or is experiencing some other kind of grief, we're often at a loss for words for how to comfort them.", 'It gets even trickier when we share in some measure of the person\'s grief. When your friend finds out they have a terminal illness, that\'s painful for your friend and their family, but also for you. While it\'s important to honor that, it\'s also important to recognize that your grief isn\'t the same as the person afflicted, nor is it the same as their spouse\'s or children\'s or parents\' grief. It\'s totally fine to feel the weight of your own sadness and loss, but there are appropriate and inappropriate places to put that weight. For example, saying to a mutual friend, "I can\'t handle this, it\'s too devastating" is very different than saying the same thing directly to your friend who just found out they are dying.', 'Psychologist Susan Silk has created a helpful concept that makes figuring out what to say and what not to say a bit easier. She refers to it as the Ring Theory, and she and author Barry Goldman described it ', 'in an op-ed', ' in The Los Angeles Times. ', "Here's how it works:", 'First, draw a circle and put the name of the person in crisis in the middle of it. Then draw a ring around that and label it with the people closest to them—spouse, parents, children, etc. Then draw another ring for their intimate friends or other family members they are close to. Next, make a ring for their close co-workers, not-quite-as-close friends, distant relatives, etc., followed by a ring for other people who know them—acquaintances, community members, and such. ', 'These concentric rings represent which direction our words of comfort and empathy should go, and which direction the venting or dumping of our own feelings of grief should go. ', 'The person in the center can say anything they want to anyone, of course. The crisis is theirs and they get all the leeway and grace in how they express their feelings. People in the rings around them can vent their feelings toward people in the larger rings, but not the smaller ones. If we\'re talking to someone in a smaller ring than we are in, our words should only be comforting and empathetic, such as "I\'m so sorry you\'re going through this," or "What a terrible tragedy, let me bring you a meal to make this time a little easier for you." ', "Silk explains that when we are talking to a person in a smaller circle from us—someone who is closer to the crisis—the goal is to help. It's appropriate not to offer advice, no matter how helpful we think we're being. It's not an appropriate direction for our personal storytelling or expressions of despair, however sincere. If we feel an impulse to do those things, we should point it outward, toward the people farther from the crisis. ", 'We should never put people in smaller circles in a position of feeling like they need to comfort us. Comfort should move inward through the rings, not outward.', 'Let\'s imagine my friend Lee just lost her mother to cancer. I lost my much-loved mother-in-law to pancreatic cancer just six weeks after her diagnosis, but this is Lee\'s crisis, not mine. As a friend, I\'m not going to tell her how much I miss my mother-in-law, describe in detail how hard it was to go through losing her, or go on and on about the meaning of life and death. I\'m not going to say those things to her spouse, either. I might say, "I\'m so sorry. Cancer really sucks, and this is such a hard thing to go through" and then offer to help watch the kids or bring over a casserole. ', '\n        ', '\n        \n        \n        ', 'Concept by Susan Silk, Graphic by Annie Reneau', "If I'm talking to a mutual friend or someone Lee knows peripherally, that's when I might share my own story or how Lee's mom's death is bringing up my own feelings of grief. The key is to make sure I'm pointing that emotional venting of my own toward someone in a larger circle, not a smaller one.", "As Silk and Goldman explained, it's not so much what you say as whom you say it to.", '"If you want to scream or cry or complain, if you want to tell someone how shocked you are or how icky you feel, or whine about how it reminds you of all the terrible things that have happened to you lately, that\'s fine," ', 'they wrote', '. "It\'s a perfectly normal response. Just do it to someone in a bigger ring."', '"Comfort IN, dump OUT," they added.', "Silk and Goldman point out that most of us intuitively know not to dump our feelings on the person in the center of the circle, but we may not be conscientious enough about how we talk to those who are close to the crisis as well. The Ring Theory visual can help us see where it's appropriate to vent and where it's not, and how best to help both those who are grieving and who are in the grieving person's orbit. ", 'It can even help us recognize what we need most when we find ourselves at the center of the circle. All of us will be there at one time or another, and knowing where we are in the rings can help us know how to comfort one another through our grieving processes.', 'In strange-but-true news, the last known surviving spouse of a Civil War veteran just died last month.

Republican election official in Georgia publicly debunks President Trump's fraud claims:	["By now most Americans have heard, or at least heard about, President Trump's ", 'hour-long phone call ', 'with Georgia\'s Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, in which the sitting president attempted to convince the official in charge of Georgia\'s election to "recalculate" and "find" him enough votes to overturn the state\'s results in his favor. ', 'The criminal implications inherent in the asking aside, the phone call was filled with baseless allegations that the president has "heard" and that "Trump media" has been sharing. It\'s the constant drumbeat of the past two months—the counts are wrong, the machines were rigged, the votes were flipped, the ballots were counted multiple times, fake ballots were brought in, signatures weren\'t checked, the recount was wrong, the audit was corrupt, and so on and so on and so on. The breadth and depth of fraud allegations is stunning, which is exactly the point. One or two allegations are easily checked and either verified or debunked. Flooding media with every allegation in the book makes it 1) impossible to debunk due to the sheer volume, and 2) more likely that some of the allegations will be believed, regardless of actual evidence. ', "It's Steve Bannon's ", '"flood the zone with sh*t" ', 'approach to handling the media, and unfortunately, it works. ', 'However, at some point, people need to realize that the real experts on elections are the actual experts on elections. That\'s not the president of the United States. That\'s not random poll observers. That\'s not any of the Newsmax or OAN reporters. That\'s not any of the so-called "data scientists" (', "some of whom hilariously turn out to be Sean Hannity's producer", ') who make claims in non-binding hearings but not in court. ', "In the U.S., the people elected and appointed to serve as state election officials are the final authority on whether or not an election was run properly. (Unless a lawsuit leads to a court deciding that something went awry, of course. As of now, Trump's legal team and allies are ", '1 and 61 in court', ' for election cases. The one case they won just allowed poll watchers to stand a few feet closer to the poll workers.) ', 'One of those election officials, Republican Gabriel Sterling who serves as the Voting Systems Manager for the Secretary of State office in Georgia, spoke at a press conference today to set the record straight on the continued allegations. ', '"We\'ve seen nothing in our investigations of any of these data claims that shows there are nearly enough ballots to change the outcome. And the secretary and I at this podium have said, since November 3rd, there is illegal voting in every single election in the history of mankind because there are human beings involved in the process. It\'s going to happen. So the question is limiting it and putting as many safeguards as you can in place to make sure that it doesn\'t happen."', 'Sterling mentioned the hand tally and the allegation that Dominion machines used "fractional voting" or flipped votes. "Again, by doing the hand tally, it shows none of that is true," he said. "Not a whit." ', 'He also addressed the overall claims about the Dominion voting systems, pointing out that in the counties in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that used Dominion voting machines, Trump actually won a majority of the vote. Then he debunked the idea that 900,000 votes had been deleted, as that would have meant a mathematically impossible turnout to begin with.', '"Again, this is all easily, provably false," he said. "Yet the president persists."', 'Regarding Trump\'s allegation that some part of the Dominion machines were being switched out, Sterling said, "This one I don\'t fully understand. No one is changing parts or pieces out of Dominion voting machines. That\'s not -- I don\'t even know what that means. That\'s not a real thing. That\'s not happening. The president mentioned it on the call...from two days ago. That\'s, again, not real. I don\'t even know how exactly to explain that."', "Visual aids are always helpful, so there was also a CLAIM vs. FACT poster displayed next to Sterling as he spoke that gave specific responses to specific numbers claims. Why people just believe numbers they see online instead of going to the source—again, the actual election officials—to see the actual, verified numbers is a bit baffling, yet here we are. Here's a close-up of the poster:", "Again, Sterling is a Republican (as is Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, as Georgia's governor Brian Kemp, all of whom stand by Georgia's election result). He wanted Trump to win. He mentioned that Trump's allegations might be discouraging people from turning out to vote—especially Republicans who might be convinced that the election system is so flawed that there's no point in participating in it. ", '"Everybody\'s vote is going to count," Sterling said. "Everybody\'s vote did count."', 'Sterling referred to his press conference as yet another "Whack-a-mole" event, alluding to the fact that he has had to debunk these allegations over and over again, one at a time, for two months since the election. At one point he said he had screamed at his computer when he heard an allegation that\'s been debunked many, many times.

One woman’s quest to unite the diverse Hispanic community is also helping battling COVID-19:	['When the novel coronavirus hit the United States, life as we knew it quickly changed.

Rep. Jamie Raskin's beautiful obituary for his son is an important message about mental health:	["When Maryland Representative Jamie Raskin and his wife, Sarah Bloom, announced the death of their 25-year-old son Tommy on New Year's Eve, the whole nation mourned with them. Many also quietly wondered what had caused his death. It's not anyone's business, of course. But when a young, seemingly healthy person dies unexpectedly at home, the question lingers. ", 'Rep. Raskin provided an honest answer to that question in a way that is both heartbreaking and perfect. In ', 'a statement published on Medium,', " Raskin and Bloom shared the details of Tommy's life so beautifully, it makes anyone who reads it feel like we knew him. It also exemplifies how to talk about a loved one who is taken by mental illness.", 'The statement opens:', '"On January 30, 1995, Thomas Bloom Raskin was born to ecstatic parents who saw him enter the world like a blue-eyed cherub, a little angel. Tommy grew up as a strikingly beautiful curly-haired madcap boy beaming with laughter and charm, making mischief, kicking the soccer ball in the goal, acting out scenes from To Kill A Mockingbird with his little sister in his father\'s constitutional law class, teaching other children the names of all the Justices on the Supreme Court, hugging strangers on the street, teaching our dogs foreign languages, running up and down the aisle on airplanes giving people high fives, playing jazz piano like a blues great from Bourbon Street, and at 12 writing a detailed brief to his mother explaining why he should not have to do a Bar Mitzvah and citing Due Process liberty interests (appeal rejected)."', "The celebration of Tommy's life continues with a list of the people who surrounded him with love and support. His passion for true liberty and justice for all and his desire to solve problems of injustice, poverty, and war is clear. He loved animals and fought for their ethical treatment. He was a staunch antiwar activist. He was sensitive and kind, while also fiercely dedicated to making the world a better place for all in it.", '"He hated cliques and social snobbery," ', 'wrote Raskin, ', '"never had a negative word for anyone but tyrants and despots, and opposed all malicious gossip, stopping all such gossipers with a trademark Tommy line — \'forgive me, but it\'s hard to be a human.\'"', 'That line, "forgive me, it\'s hard to be human," resonates with us all. It also helps explain why a young man with so much promise, so much passion, and so much support around him could die from a depression that led him to suicide.', "Besides the incredibly touching way it was written, what strikes me most about this obituary is that it's exactly what an obituary of someone who dies from depression should be. When someone dies of a physical disease, we don't belabor the cause of their death. We mention it, we acknowledge it, but the focus of the write-up on their life is their actual life. ", 'Tommy clearly lived an incredible life and was a uniquely remarkable person. The disease that ended his life, even in the way it did, did not define his life.', "I've lost two family members who were in their early 20s—one to suicide and one to Type 1 diabetes. Neither of their lives were defined by the cause of their death. A young person dying is always a tragedy, but when we speak about people we lose to suicide, the wording we use matters. ", 'The kind, funny uncle I lost to suicide was a year younger than Tommy Raskin when he died. I purposely choose to say "when he died" instead of "when he killed himself" because the latter implies conscious choice, and I don\'t know how much of it was truly a choice on his part. With suicide, the intention is obviously there, but it\'s impossible to know how much control a person actually had over it in the moment. ', "There's little comfort to be found when a loved one dies of suicide. But it helps to understand that that depression, while largely treatable, is a sometimes-fatal disease. Suicide might be the mechanism, but the disease of depression is the cause, just as unregulated blood sugar is the mechanism for someone who dies from the disease of diabetes. There are treatments for depression, but sometimes the disease is resistant to treatment. We'll undoubtedly get better at treatment and prevention of depression, just as we do with all illness, but the devastating truth is that sometimes people do die from it. While it's tempting to blame yourself or search for what you could have done differently to stop it, the terrible truth is it's not always possible to prevent. ", "Raskin's obituary says this about Tommy's passing:", '"We have barely been able to scratch the surface here, but you have a sense of our son. Tommy Raskin had a perfect heart, a perfect soul, a riotously outrageous and relentless sense of humor, and a dazzling radiant mind. He began to be tortured later in his 20s by a blindingly painful and merciless \'disease called depression,\' as Tabitha put it on Facebook over the weekend, a kind of relentless torture in the brain for him, and despite very fine doctors and a loving family and friendship network of hundreds who adored him beyond words and whom he adored too, the pain became overwhelming and unyielding and unbearable at last for our dear boy, this young man of surpassing promise to our broken world.', '"On the last hellish brutal day of that godawful miserable year of 2020, when hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions of people all over the world died alone in bed in the darkness from an invisible killer disease ravaging their bodies and minds, we also lost our dear, dear, beloved son, Hannah and Tabitha\'s beloved irreplaceable brother, a radiant light in this broken world.', '"He left us this farewell note on New Year\'s Eve day: \'Please forgive me. My illness won today. Please look after each other, the animals, and the global poor for me. All my love, Tommy.\'"', 'Tommy clearly made his mark on the world while he was here, which is more than many who spent many more years on this earth can say.
