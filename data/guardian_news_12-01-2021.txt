Military helicopters may be sent to evacuate Covid patients from Isle of Wight:	Military  helicopters could be used within days to airlift coronavirus patients from the Isle of Wight, the island’s medical director has said, after an “astronomical” rise in infections fuelled by mixing and visitors over Christmas. A 71-fold increase in cases means the Isle of Wight has the 13th highest infection rate in the UK this week, from having one of the lowest in early December. The county of 141,606 people recorded 1,871 new cases in the first 10 days of January – 43% of its total since the pandemic began. Hospital admissions and deaths are rising sharply. Stephen Parker, the medical director of the Isle of Wight NHS trust, said he was planning “unthinkable options”, including evacuating Covid-19 patients to the mainland as the island’s small hospital treated a four-fold increase in people with the disease since Christmas Day. He told the Guardian that a Chinook helicopter, more commonly seen in war zones, had carried out a test landing on a playing field near the island’s St Mary’s hospital in anticipation that military aid might be needed before the end of January. “These are unprecedented times for the NHS and they are unprecedented times for the island,” he said. “I think it really is important to realise that we are one of the smallest hospitals in the country; we are challenged about moving patients and we could be overwhelmed.” The Isle of Wight had considered itself a Covid success story before December, managing to keep the virus mostly at bay. It  spearheaded a trial  of the government’s contact-tracing app. “Where the Isle of Wight leads, the rest of Britain will follow,” declared Matt Hancock, the health secretary, at the time. That all changed last month. The lifting of the national lockdown in December left the island one of only three places in  England  in the lowest level of restrictions. It meant islanders could meet in groups of up to six, hotels were open and pubs were allowed to serve alcohol without food. Yet Portsmouth, only a 45-minute ferry trip away, and one of the first places to see significant transmission of the highly-contagious new Covid variant, was in  the strictest tier 4 restrictions , alongside London. The rapid rise in the infection rate – from 16 cases per 100,000 people in the first week of December to 1,130 per 100,000 this week – has prompted fury among some islanders who blame an influx of visitors from mainland England, including second homeowners, in the run-up to Christmas. One resident  told the  County Press he saw “coaches of people piling into local hotels and evening lights ablaze in the many second homes” on the island, whose elderly population – more than one in three residents are 60 or over – are particularly vulnerable to the disease. Twenty-two Isle of Wight residents died of Covid-19 in the first 10 days of January – 19% of its total since the crisis began and on course to top the 39 fatalities in May, its deadliest month so far. The number of Covid patients in the island’s only hospital has nearly quadrupled since Christmas day, up to nearly 70 people, or about one in four of all beds. David Stewart, the Conservative leader of Isle of Wight council, said he believed “there are some people over here who shouldn’t be here” and that some islanders had visited the mainland before Christmas. He told the Guardian he would meet police forces and ferry companies this week to discuss what more could be done to identify those flouting the rules. Parker said the Isle of Wight was paying the price for being in tier 1 before Christmas. He said: “Quite clearly, we’ve obviously had a massive increase in transmission between individuals and that’s a reflection of individual behaviours. It’s not up to me to make political comments as to why that has occurred but if we think that every interaction has to be essential, I would challenge people who either travel to the island to their second home and I would also challenge people on the island who possibly have been to the mainland ‘to do their Christmas shopping’. “I would certainly challenge people who actually continued to have a relatively normal social life when we were in tier 1. I think tier 1 gave people false reassurance. And my personal view is that we are now paying the price for that.” The island’s Conservative MP, Bob Seely,  said  there was “no basis in fact” for the claim that that second-home owners had brought the new strain to the island, pointing out that many key workers travel to and from mainland England every day. Seely  apologised in June  for attending a barbecue, alongside the Brexit party chairman and political journalists, at a time when there was strict guidance against groups mixing from different households or people visiting and entering another person’s home or garden. Seely said he was unaware others would be present when he arrived for a meeting, and that social distancing had been followed at all times. Parker praised St Mary’s medics for doing a “fantastic job” while under strain, with staff absences two to three times higher than usual, but said there was “anxiety that sometimes stretches to fear” about the next fortnight. “If the NHS is going to be overwhelmed, it is going to be the next two to four weeks. And that’s why it is so scary having gone from what was a relatively stable position in the autumn.”
Trump rejects responsibility for Capitol riot he inspired and claims his words 'totally appropriate' – live:	Jim Jordan  argued against the resolution calling for the 25th amendment to be invoked, saying the measure would further divide the nation. The Republican congressman’s comments to the House rules committee came less than a week after  Donald Trump  incited a violent mob to storm the Capitol. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH): "Congress needs to stop this, this effort to remove the president from office ... These actions will only continue to divide the nation.” (A right-wing insurrection based on election fraud lies really divides the nation.)  pic.twitter.com/HWukqGwD9K “Congress needs to stop this, this effort to remove the president from office just one week before he is set to leave,” Jordan said. “These actions will only again continue to divide the nation.”  Jim McGovern,  the Democratic chairman of the committee, criticized Jordan for contributing to Trump’s lies about widespread fraud in the presidential election. McGovern pressed Jordan to acknowledge that Biden fairly won the election, but the Republican congressman repeatedly dodged. “I said that  Joe Biden  won the election but that there were problems with how it was done,” Jordan said. As a reminder, Trump and his allies have produced no credible evidence to substantiate their claims of widespread fraud. The House rules committee is now debating a resolution calling on  Mike Pence  and the cabinet to invoke the 25th amendment and remove  Donald Trump  from office. Congressman  Jamie Raskin,  who crafted the resolution, said the violent riot at the Capitol last week, incited by the president, justified the measure. Rep. Jamie Raskin on House resolution calling for Trump's removal: "The time of 25th Amendment emergency has arrived. It has come to our doorstep. It has invaded our chamber."  https://t.co/fOyKRem7Wc   pic.twitter.com/QOJ1OJwouM “The time of 25th amendment emergency has arrived,” Raskin, a Democrat of Maryland, said. “It has come to our doorstep. It has invaded our chamber.”  The full House is expected to vote on the resolution this evening, before tomorrow’s debate on the article of impeachment against Trump. House members have been warned that one terrorist plot  ahead of Joe Biden’s inauguration  involves thousands of people surrounding the US Capitol,  according to CNN . Congressman  Conor Lamb,  one of the lawmakers briefed on security concerns last night, said that the threats the government is receiving are “very specific”. As the FBI warns about "armed protests" being planned at all 50 state capitols and in Washington, DC, Rep. Conor Lamb says the threats are very “specific.” “We are not negotiating with or reasoning with these people. They have to be prosecuted. They have to be stopped.”  pic.twitter.com/JG5tqGljYk “They were talking about 4,000 armed ‘patriots’ to surround the Capitol and prevent any Democrat from going in,” Lamb, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, told CNN this morning.  “They have published rules of engagement, meaning when you shoot and when you don’t. So this is an organized group that has a plan. They are committed to doing what they’re doing because I think in their minds, you know, they are patriots and they’re talking about 1776 and so this is now a contest of wills.” Lamb added, “We are not negotiating with or reasoning with these people. They have to be prosecuted. They have to be stopped. And unfortunately, that includes the president, which is why he needs to be impeached and removed from office.” CNN  has more details on the briefing :  Two Democratic lawmakers who participated in the briefing told CNN that they were walked through several scenarios on a call Monday and officers were sober about the threats. An effort was made to emphasize how different security is right now, the members said. ‘They are very strong when we are weak. That is when the mob psychology takes hold and they are emboldened, but when met with actual determined force, I think a lot of these fantasy world beliefs about what will happen when they come to Washington will melt away,’ one of the members said.   The member added that lawmakers are hoping National Guard troops who are being dispatched to the capital are vetted, because while lawmakers trust most of them, many will be coming in from all over the country.  A third member of the  House of Representatives  has tested positive for coronavirus after lawmakers were forced to shelter in place together during the violent riot at the Capitol last week. Brad Schneider,  a Democrat of Illinois, announced his diagnosis in a statement that specifically called out  Republicans  who refused to wear masks during the lockdown. Unfortunately, I received a positive COVID-19 test this morning following being tested yesterday on the advice of the House Attending Physician. “Last Wednesday, after narrowly escaping a violent mob incited by the President of the United States to attack the Capitol and its occupants, I was forced to spend several hours in a secure but confined location with dozens of other Members of Congress,” Schneider said in a statement. “Several Republican lawmakers in the room adamantly refused to wear a mask, as demonstrated in  video  from Punchbowl News, even when politely asked by their colleagues. Today, I am now in strict isolation, worried that I have risked my wife’s health and angry at the selfishness and arrogance of the anti-maskers who put their own contempt and disregard for decency ahead of the health and safety of their colleagues and our staff.” Schneider is the third House member to test positive since last Wednesday. Fellow Democrats  Pramila Jayapal  and  Bonnie Watson Coleman  have also announced they were diagnosed with coronavirus.  Schneider said he has thankfully not yet experienced any symptoms and is receiving excellent medical care. “Wearing a mask is not a political statement, it is public health guidance, common courtesy, and simply what should be expected of all decent people,” Schneider added in the statement. “We can no longer tolerate Members coming to the floor or gathering in the halls of Congress without doing the bare minimum to protect those around them.” Donald Trump  refused to take responsibility for his role in the riot at the Capitol, claiming his words to supporters shortly before the violence were “totally appropriate”. Speaking to reporters shortly before leaving for Texas to champion his work on the border wall, the president was asked about a pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol last week. Q: "What is your role in what happened at the Capitol? What is your personal responsibility?" President Trump: "If you read my speech...people thought that what I said was totally appropriate."  pic.twitter.com/90Pdt8xFSz “We want no violence,” Trump said. “On the impeachment, it’s really a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics.” He added, “I think it’s causing tremendous danger to our country, and it’s causing tremendous anger. I want no violence.” During a separate gaggle with reporters shortly after he made those comments, Trump was asked what his role was in the violent riot. “People thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” Trump said of his speech to supporters shortly before the riot. In that speech, the president explicitly told his supporters to march to the Capitol as lawmakers certified  Joe Biden ’s victory in the presidential race. Five people have died as a result of the violence. Harvard University has announced it is removing  Elise Stefanik,  a Republican congresswoman of New York, from an advisory committee over her role in promoting baseless claims of widespread fraud in the presidential election. Doug Elmendorf,  the dean of Harvard Kennedy School, said Stefanik would no longer serve on the school’s Senior Advisory Committee, following a review by school leaders.  “Elise has made public assertions about voter fraud in November’s presidential election that have no basis in evidence, and she has made public statements about court actions related to the election that are incorrect,” Elmendorf said in a statement. “Moreover, these assertions and statements do not reflect policy disagreements but bear on the foundations of the electoral process through which this country’s leaders are chosen.” Elmendorf said he asked Stefanik, who graduated from Harvard in 2006, to step aside from the board. After she declined to do so, Elmendorf removed her from the post. 🚨🚨My statement on  @Harvard   @harvardiop   @Kennedy_School  bowing to the woke Far-Left 🚨🚨  pic.twitter.com/DjvgdqAI1O In characteristic fashion, Stefanik blamed Harvard’s decision to hold her accountable for spreading lies that culminated in a riot at the Capitol on cancel culture. James Comey said he was “sickened” by the attack on the Capitol last week,  emphasizing that all of the rioters involved should face federal charges. “It’s important that every last person who entered that Capitol be found and charged.” Watch  @SavannahGuthrie ’s full interview with Former FBI Director James  @Comey  on the U.S. Capitol siege and new inauguration threats.  pic.twitter.com/JSFEFz9Q9y Speaking to the “Today” show this morning, the former FBI director said, “It’s important that every last person who entered that Capitol be found and charged.”  Comey, who is promoting a new book, criticized law enforcement leaders over the “lack of preparation” for the riot last week, despite clear signs from some of  Donald Trump ’s supporters that they were prepared for violence. Comey, who was abruptly fired by the president, added that he believed Trump should be impeached but not prosecuted at the federal level.  “I still think it would be better for this country if we move past a fallen and corrupt president and turned off the television lights on him, which in some ways would be the greatest punishment he could imagine,” Comey said. Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services, would not say whether the 25th amendment should be invoked to remove  Donald Trump  from office. Speaking to ABC News this morning, the cabinet secretary also would not say whether he has discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th amendment with other senior officials. HHS Sec. Alex Azar won't say if he'd vote to remove Trump: "The rhetoric last week was unacceptable. I'm not going to get into or discuss the 25th Amendment here. I've wrestled with this, I'm committed to see this through in my role as Health Sec. during a pandemic..."  pic.twitter.com/yD1vwwPBMv Instead, Azar said he is “committed to” remaining in his role, due to the coronavirus pandemic, and argued it would “not be appropriate” to discuss his conversations with colleagues or the president. “The rhetoric last week was unacceptable,” Azar said. “I’m not going to get into or discuss the 25th Amendment here. I’ve wrestled with this, I’m committed to see this through in my role as health secretary during a pandemic to ensure that vaccines and therapeutics get out to the American people and to ensure a smooth handoff to president-elect Biden’s team.” This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. Republican politicians are offering their condolences to the family of Sheldon Adelson,  the prominent party donor who has died at 87. George W Bush,  the former Republican president, said in a statement, “Laura and I mourn the passing of a friend, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon battled his way out of a tough Boston neighborhood to build a successful enterprise that loyally employed tens of thousands - and entertained millions. He was an American patriot and a strong supporter of Israel.” “Our nation lost a remarkable American with the passing of my friend Sheldon Adelson,” Senate majority leader  Mitch McConnell  said. “Sheldon built an incredible life and career. He climbed from sleeping on tenement floors during the Great Depression as a young boy to literally towering over Las Vegas and beyond. He created countless jobs in the process.” By the way, here’s what we’ve got in the diary for later today. President  Donald Trump  departs the White House at 10am ET (3pm GMT) to head for Alamo in Texas where he is expected to give remarks about immigration and visit the southern US border wall. Vice president  Mike Pence  leads a governors video teleconference on Covid-19 response and recovery at 2pm ET. President-elect  Joe Biden  receives the president’s daily brief and meets with transition advisors. In Congress, the  House of Representatives  debates a resolution from 9am calling on Pence to strip Trump of his powers using the 25th Amendment to the constitution . It will go to a vote later on and is expected to pass. You will be able to watch those proceedings live here on the blog. The supreme court is sitting this morning, and hears oral argument in Uzuegbunam v Preczewski , a case concerning a Georgia college student’s civil suit against the school for alleged violations of his free speech and free exercise of religion rights. Donald Trump Jr  appears to be the first member of the Trump family to pay public tribute to Sheldon Adelson, a major Republican and Trump donor, whose  death has just been announced . Sheldon was a true American patriot and a giant among men. He treated his employees like family. His philanthropic generosity changed countless lives. The US-Israel relationship is stronger today because of him. My heart goes out to the Adelson family.  https://t.co/AjZHPVsD1e J Oliver Conroy  looks for us today  at the role of Sen. Josh Hawley in last week’s assault on the Capitol, and what the future may hold for the 41-year-old US senator from Missouri, who has positioned himself as a more polished successor to Donald Trump, who can unite rightwing nationalism with populist economic policies. Unlike Donald Trump, Hawley did not  directly encourage  the pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol last Wednesday. But his move to muddy the legitimacy of the election undoubtedly fanned the flames. Now, with five people dead, human excrement  smeared  on the walls of a building many Americans regard as close to sacred, and widespread calls for Trump to resign or face impeachment, Hawley may have succeeded in casting himself as a mini-Trump –  and is facing an accordingly fierce  backlash. Although he condemned the violence at the Capitol, Hawley has doubled down on his decision to challenge the election. “I will never apologize for giving voice to the millions of Missourians and Americans who have concerns about the integrity of our elections,” he said in a public statement after the riot. “That’s my job, and I will keep doing it.” As blowback builds, the question is whether Hawley – now an overnight pariah in Washington – will suffer politically for his wild gamble to pander to a minority of Americans who are diehard Trump supporters, and include Qanon conspiracy theorists. His decision to cast his lot with would-be insurrectionists, if only indirectly, may have been  a bridge too far  for many Americans. Hawley’s mentor, the Republican former senator John Danforth, recently  told  the St Louis Post-Dispatch: “Supporting Josh and trying so hard to get him elected to the Senate was the worst mistake I ever made in my life.” Simon & Schuster has  cancelled publication  of a forthcoming book by Hawley. Several Democratic members of Congress have  called  for Hawley and Cruz to resign, as  has  his home state newspaper, the Kansas City Star. Read more of J Oliver Conroy’s report here:  Josh Hawley fanned the flames for diehard Trump voters. Will his gambit pay off? Nobel laureate in economics Joseph Stiglitz writes for us today, asking  whether Donald Trump an aberration or a symptom of a deeper US malady? The immediate task is to remove the threat Trump still poses. The  House of Representatives  should impeach him now, and the Senate should try him some time later, to bar him from holding federal office again. It should be in the interest of the Republicans, no less than the Democrats, to show that no one, not even the president, is above the law. But we should not sleep comfortably until the underlying problems are addressed. Many involve great challenges. We must reconcile freedom of expression with accountability for the enormous harm that social media can and has caused, from inciting violence and promoting racial and religious hatred to political manipulation. We Americans must reform our political system, both to ensure the basic right to vote and democratic representation. We need a new voting rights act. The old one, adopted in 1965, was aimed at the South, where disenfranchisement of African-Americans had enabled white elites to remain in power since the end of Reconstruction following the civil war. But now anti-democratic practices are found throughout the country. We also need to decrease the influence of money in our politics: no system of checks and balances can be effective in a society with as much inequality as the US. And any system based on “one dollar, one vote” rather than “one person, one vote” will be vulnerable to populist demagogy. After all, how can such a system serve the interests of the country as a whole? Read more here:  Joseph Stiglitz – Is Donald Trump an aberration or a symptom of a deeper US malady? Sheldon Adelson , the billionaire mogul and power broker who built a casino empire spanning from Las Vegas to China and became a singular force in domestic and international politics has died after a long illness, his wife said this morning. Associated Press report that both Miriam Adelson and the Las Vegas Sands Corp. released statements confirming Adelson’s death. He was 87. Mrs Adelson called her husband “an American patriot: a US army veteran who gave generously to wounded warriors and, wherever he could, looked to the advancement of these great United States”. “He was the proudest of Jews,” she said, adding that he “saw in the state of Israel not only the realization of an historical promise to a unique and deserving people, but also a gift from the Almighty to all of humanity.” He was the son of Jewish immigrants, raised with two siblings in a Boston tenement, who over the second half of his life became one of the world’s richest men. The chairman and CEO of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation brought singing gondoliers to the Las Vegas Strip and foresaw correctly that Asia would be an even bigger market. In 2018, Forbes ranked him No 15 in the US, worth an estimated $35.5bn. Adelson was considered the nation’s most influential Republican donor over the final years of his life, at times setting records for individual contributions during a given election cycle. “Mike Pompeo is tweeting again” appears to have become the new “the president is awake and tweeting” on this blog. Pretty much every day since 1 January the secretary of state has been using his official US government account to publish his CV for his 2024 run for the presidency  outline what he sees as his legacy of his time in office These have mostly consisted of posts scheduled every half hour on the dot tackling topics like China, Russia, the UN, religious freedom and so on, with glossy Pompeo 2024 campaign adverts  quote cards that have been produced, presumably, by the state department.

Ewan Palmer reports for Newsweek : Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative student group Turning Point USA, has dismissed any suggestion that the attack on the Capitol last week was an insurrection and that many of those taking part were merely expressing “bad judgment.” A video of Kirk downplaying the deadly attack in which far-right extremists and QAnon conspiracy theorists stormed Congress, was shared on Twitter. During the clip, Kirk said while it was “not wise” to climb the Capitol steps and storm the corridors of the building, it is wrong to compare those who did to terrorists such as the Oklahoma Bomber. “Not wise does not mean you’re an insurrectionist,” Kirk said. “Just because you do something stupid, does not mean your Timothy McVeigh. Just because you do something that is regrettable does not mean that you are planning an armed insurrection against the United States government.” However, Kirk may have some vested interest in downplaying events which saw a police officer killed, property destroyed and stolen, and Trump supporters carrying zip-ties in an apparent preparedness to kidnap lawmakers. The report continues: A number of people on social media suggested that Kirk was attempting to distance himself from the violence which erupted in the nation’s capital after previously claiming that Turning Point Action, the political action committee arm of Turning Point USA, would be sending “80+ buses full of patriots” to attend the capital in a since deleted-tweet. “The historic event will likely be one of the largest and most consequential in American history,” Kirk tweeted two days before January 6. “The team at @TrumpStudents & Turning Point Action are honored to help make this happen, sending 80+ buses full of patriots to DC to fight for this president.” Turning Point Action have since claimed that the group sent just seven buses, and that Kirk had not been accurate in his boast. Read more here:  Newsweek – Charlie Kirk says Capitol attack was not insurrection after deleting ‘80+ buses’ tweet So, if the Senate is unlikely to ultimately find  Donald Trump  guilty in an impeachment trial, given that a two-thirds majority is required and that the chamber will be balanced 50-50, what next? John Nichols writes for the Nation on  how a 14th Amendment strategy could bar Trump from ever holding office again . To imagine that Trump will fade away after January 20 requires the denial of everything Americans know about the president’s massive ego, his aversion to being seen as a loser, and his determination to avenge his defeat in the 2020 election.  Added to the Constitution after the Civil War, the 14th Amendment is a blunt instrument, which mandates in its third section: “No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who … shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” Section 5 of the amendment declares, “The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.” This is why focusing on the 14th Amendment is relevant. As Pulitzer Prize–winning historian Eric Foner reminds us, the House and Senate House could, with a simple majority vote, censure Trump for inciting insurrection and, with the approval of a President  Joe Biden , effectively bar Trump from running again for the presidency. “This can be invoked against anyone who has ever taken an oath to support the Constitution, including the president,” Foner says of the 14th Amendment. “It’s much simpler than impeachment. It is not a judicial proceeding. It’s a political proceeding. It doesn’t involve lawyers or trials. It is simply about qualification for office. You could have one afternoon of debate and a vote.” Read more details here:  The Nation – How a 14th Amendment strategy could bar Trump from ever holding office again

What is bitcoin and why are so many people looking to buy it?:	Bitcoin is a type of digital currency that emerged after the 2008 financial crisis. It allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods. It has become the most prominent among thousands of so-called  cryptocurrencies . It relies on  “blockchain” technology , which is a shared database of transactions, with entries that must be confirmed and encrypted. The network is secured by individuals called “miners” who use  high-powered computers to verify transactions , with bitcoins offered as a reward. There are more than 18m in existence, and the mathematical system controlling the generation of new bitcoins – which is decentralised and therefore has no overarching institution such as a central bank – has a hardwired maximum of 21m coins. There are several currency exchanges where consumers can swap traditional “fiat” money – backed by governments – for cryptocurrencies, which must be stored using a digital wallet. Some of the biggest exchanges include Bitstamp, Coinbase and Gemini. However, finance firms have also created new investment products based on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, such as contracts for difference, which are used to track the value of an asset without needing to directly own it. There are problems when it comes to using bitcoin as a currency, with many people simply owning it as a speculative investment instead, given its tendency for extreme swings in value. Within the space of a single hour on Monday alone, its value fell by about $3,000 (£2,230), then rose again by about $2,000. This makes it almost impossible to put a reliable price on goods and services. Instead, there are ways to pay using applications such as BitPay, which converts bitcoin funds in a digital wallet to pay for goods in traditional currencies used by retailers. Transactions are growing, more so online than in physical shops, with firms including Microsoft, Lush and Expedia accepting payments. The first-ever bitcoin transaction was made in 2010, when a Florida man paid a British man 10,000 bitcoins to order him two Papa John’s pizzas. Today that would be worth more than $300m. The  City regulator is concerned  crypto investment firms could be overstating potential payouts, or understating the risks, from investing in bitcoin and products related to the digital currency. As a newer and relatively lightly regulated market, consumers are unlikely to have access to state-backed compensation if something goes wrong. There has also been a boom in  bitcoin scams . There are three main factors influencing the bitcoin price. First, the media frenzy over its boom in value, drawing in new buyers looking to make money. Second, more traditional finance firms are investing in the market. And finally, comparisons between bitcoin and gold, which fit with trends in the global economy. The development of Covid-19 vaccines could enable a swift economic recovery from the pandemic, at a time when governments and central banks are still providing vast amounts of emergency support – which could trigger a burst of inflation. Some investors view bitcoin as a store of value, similar to gold, which can hold its worth during times of economic stress or rising inflation. Bitcoin’s value is almost entirely defined by perceptions. Some economists believe it is entirely worthless. However, analysts at JP Morgan have said it could hit $146,000 if it became as established as gold for investors. However, to match this reputation built up over millennia – as a thing worth owning, with otherwise little intrinsic value – it would need to become much less volatile.
Paramedic in new year honours list calls for global health equality:	A paramedic who volunteered for eight months caring for people in one of the world’s most remote communities has called for action to erode stark global health inequalities after being awarded a  British Empire Medal  (BEM) for services to emergency medicine and disaster response. Nich Woolf, who turned 68 on New Year’s Day and is originally from London, had planned to be in  Vanuatu  – more than 2,000 miles (3,200km) off Australia’s east coast – working with ambulance crews from February to April but was only able to return home in mid-October due to pandemic travel restrictions. “Because all the Australians went home as their government said they had to, I was left on Santo island as the only qualified paramedic, along with three local students,” Woolf said. “I was essentially on call from end of March through to October when I left.” The paramedic, who along with working for ambulance crews in the west of England and Wales has volunteered in Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Haiti, added of the award: “It was a complete surprise and a shock. I’m very proud of it. I’ve always thought that the best thing I could do with my life was to help other people. “Give a man a fish and feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for life. So I’ve shared knowledge with people and in return they often share their knowledge with me, even when healthcare resources are not good. “My volunteer work has kept me going in my life. That’s what I’m about, I believe in using any skills that I have to benefit other people.” With Vanuatu’s largest island not having a working X-ray machine and limited other facilities, some patients Woolf reached had to be sent by air almost 200 miles to the country’s capital and main hub, Port Vila, while others with conditions and diseases more easily treatable in the west died, unable to receive the necessary care due to the poor infrastructure. “These were things that are serious but would easily be dealt with in the UK,” said Woolf. “It was a difficult time. I was having to really stretch myself as a paramedic to deal with things. It’s lovely to be recognised in the new year honours but it brings up a lot of feelings about how much more work there is to do to sort out the health inequalities that exist in the world. “It’s worth putting a lot of effort into helping people get the healthcare they deserve. People say they’ll spend money on hospitals but seem to spend it on weapons instead.” In early April, the Pacific archipelago of approximately 80 islands  was hit by a cyclone  that brought winds of almost 200mph and destroyed whole villages. “The place was wrecked and the southern half of the island was devastated,” he said. “A lot of villages in the rainforest had lost every single building, including dozens of kindergartens, which for some children could be their only ever schooling.” To help raise money to build a new preschool on Espiritu Santo, the largest island, Woolf teamed up with other expats to present a funding proposal for about £7,000 to the UK, Australia and New Zealand high commissions. “Its not fully sorted but we have had some good offers,” said Woolf, who is also a trustee of Somerset charity Festival Medical Services.
Poor families' living costs have surged during pandemic, UK study finds:	More than a third of the UK’s poorest families have seen their already meagre incomes squeezed during the pandemic because they have had to spend more on food, gas and electricity, and home schooling, a study has revealed. The  Resolution Foundation  thinktank found that while UK household spending broadly dropped and financial savings increased during the Covid crisis, this was not the case for many low-income families, who saw basic living costs surge. The government had failed to provide effective support for the poorest families, it said, and with the third lockdown expected to last months, it urged ministers to retain the  £20 pandemic top-up  to universal credit beyond April, as well as boost other benefits for the low-paid. “The study shines an unforgiving light on the absence of targeted, adequate support for families on a low income, who today face the combined insecurity of Covid-19 and increased financial pressure,” said the study. This added pressure came after years of weak growth in living standards for the poorest households, in turn leading to a general worsening of mental health, it added. It said: “Financial worries have been added to the general stress and anxiety of the pandemic for many families with children.” While higher-income groups were able to save money they would ordinarily have spent on commuting, eating out or holidays – and often spent this windfall on luxuries – those in the lowest income cohort often struggled to make ends meet, the study found. One woman interviewed for the research contrasted how rising food costs had eaten up “every penny of her savings”, while her better-off nephew “has been able to get his garden done with artificial grass and bought a hot tub with what he has saved”. One woman with children, living on on universal credit, told researchers: “The assumption is that spending has gone down. But that’s coming from the perspective of people who have disposable income … If you had no outgoings on luxuries like coffee shops, takeaway, clothes shopping, pubs, eating out etc, then nothing has been saved.” She added: “Our only saving has been £2.50 a week we spent on playgroup, and on petrol as we drive out to places less. On a whole we have seen our spending increase. Our electricity and gas bills have gone up for a start, as we’re at home more. We have spent a lot more on food, especially during the first lockdown when there were shortages and we had to buy expensive brands.” Many poorer families found the extra costs of feeding and entertaining children at home pushed up spending when schools closed, as did the need to equip school-age sons and daughters with laptops and broadband access for online learning. Normal coping strategies employed by poorer families – visiting friends and families for occasional meals, or using the library for free internet access, and charity shops for cheap clothes – became harder as a result of household mixing restrictions and the closure of libraries and non-essential retail. The study incorporates research by the Nuffield Foundation-funded  Covid Realities  project, which has tracked the experiences of low-income families and carers over the course of the pandemic as well as surveys of 6,000 UK adults in May and September. Dr Ruth Patrick, a lecturer in social policy at the University of York, who leads the Covid Realities research programme said: “While the need for the lockdown is clear, there is an equally urgent need to address the additional financial pressures that families on a low-income face through greater income support to families with dependent children.” A government spokesperson said: “We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond to ensure that nobody is left behind. “That’s why we’ve targeted our support to those most in need by raising the living wage, spending hundreds of billions to safeguard jobs, boosting welfare support by billions and introducing the £170m covid winter grant scheme to help children and families stay warm and well-fed during the coldest months.”
IFS calls for a fairer UK after Covid brings greater inequality:	A leading thinktank has called for action to make Britain a fairer country after its research showed that the Covid-19 pandemic had led to greater  inequality . The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the most vulnerable – those on lower incomes, the young, the least-educated and people from  black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds  – had been hit hardest by the crisis. Covid-19 has “cruelly exposed huge variations in how easily we are able to weather threats to livelihoods, to educational progress, to physical and mental health”, the IFS said. “These disparities have been closely correlated with pre-existing inequalities between groups according to their education, income, location and ethnicity – in ways that are often hard to disentangle, but depressingly familiar.” Eighteen months ago, the IFS launched a  five-year study of inequality  headed by the economics Nobel laureate Sir Angus Deaton. In a new year update, the thinktank said the pandemic had thrown up challenges that could not be ducked. The report noted that: Mortality rates in the most deprived communities were about twice as high as those in the least deprived. BAME groups were more likely to die than the white majority, in part reflecting their occupations. The better-paid and more highly educated had found it easier to cope financially with the crisis. Among graduates, there had been a 7% fall in the number doing any paid work; among non-graduates it was 17%. Children from poorer families found it harder to do schoolwork during lockdown, received less online teaching, and have been more likely to miss school since September. Elderly people have suffered high mortality rates from Covid-19, but the young have felt the economic consequences, with the under-25s more than twice as likely as older workers to have lost their jobs. The IFS said: “We need to do more to ensure greater economic opportunities for minority ethnic groups, and ensure that they are not consigned to low-paid and self-employed occupations. They would benefit disproportionately from policies that, for example, provided greater security for the self-employed and others in insecure work, improved pay and conditions in health and social care, and supported progress through the labour market.” The report also said that without targeted support for children who had fallen behind as a result of the crisis, the “huge educational inequalities that existed” before the pandemic were almost certain to get worse. The IFS said the risk of permanent scarring to the younger generation would be reduced if help was provided to school leavers and graduates looking for work and training. Asset prices had been bolstered by  Bank of England action to support the economy , making it important for the Treasury to support the young and those without wealth. Deaton said: “As the vaccines should, at some point this year, take us into a world largely free of the pandemic, it is imperative to think about policies that will be needed to repair the damage and that focus on those who have suffered the most. We need to build a country in which everyone feels that they belong.”
‘This is Africa’s generational cause,’ says Uganda’s election challenger:	Millions of voters in  Uganda  will cast their votes this week in an election pitting a 76-year-old president seeking his sixth term against a former popular musician half his age. The contest between  Bobi Wine , 38, and  Yoweri Museveni , who has been in power since 1986, is being keenly watched across the continent, where veteran leaders are coming under pressure to give way to politicians more representative of Africa’s increasingly youthful, urban and educated population. Wine has explicitly linked his campaign to efforts elsewhere across  Africa  to oust veteran leaders, and told the  Observer  that his was “a generational cause”. “The oppressed people can’t stay oppressed for ever. History has taught us that even the most brutal and famous dictators have come down, crumbling to the power of the people,” Wine said. “My warning to Museveni is to learn from history. It’s important that you respect the voices of the people of Uganda because, if you do not, then you will also end up in the dustbin of history like your friends [Muammar] Gaddafi, [Robert] Mugabe and [Omar al-] Bashir. The campaign has already been marked by the worst political violence in Uganda for decades,  with more than 50 people shot dead by security forces  over two days of protests following the arrest of Wine in November. On 1 December, police fired shots into Wine’s car, prompting him to briefly suspend his campaign. Since then, a bodyguard has been killed when run over by a police truck, and Wine was arrested for a second time. Opposition supporters have been routinely dispersed by security forces using teargas and rubber bullets. Journalists have been harassed, and human rights activists and high-profile critics of the government have been detained. International watchdogs such as Amnesty International say measures implemented ostensibly to fight Covid-19 are being applied selectively to prevent the opposition campaigning effectively. Wine said: “The campaign is crazy. Every day we are met with heavily armed military officers. I am afraid and concerned every day. I fear for my life and lives of my comrades in the struggle. “The regime is after our lives. Every day we live is as if it’s the last one.” On 7 January,  police confronted Wine during an online press conference  where he announced a petition to the international criminal court to investigate rights abuses in Uganda. Known to supporters as “the ghetto president”, the former singer broke into formal politics in 2017 when he won a seat in Uganda’s national assembly. He has since been badly assaulted and detained many times. Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, grew up in poverty in Kampala before his successful musical career. As a politician, he has attracted enthusiastic support from among Uganda’s young and urban population who want change. The median age in the country is less than 16. Flavia Namukasa, 23, was among hundreds of jubilant supporters who attended Wine’s campaign rally in the central town of Rakai, 200km from the capital Kampala, in late December. “We have come out in big numbers to support Bobi Wine. He is our only hope. He will be able to address our misery, daily suffering and high unemployment rates,” she said. But Wine faces an experienced opponent who can count on loyalty from individuals and institutions that have benefited from his rule over decades. Museveni is seeking a sixth term after MPs removed constitutional age limits on the presidency, and has the support of the security forces and much of the bureaucracy. Some voters have been rattled by the violence associated with recent protests, which they blame on the opposition. More importantly, decades of economic growth and subsidies have won Museveni a mass following in rural areas. “My next president still remains Museveni. Although they call him Mzee [old man], he is not weak. He is still strong and able to lead this country,” said Richard Kiboneka, a 62-year-old local leader in Mbalwa in the central district of Wakiso. Though few deny Museveni’s early achievements – from 1992 to 2013 the proportion of Ugandan households living in poverty was halved – serious economic problems were increasingly evident, even before the hammer blow of the pandemic. While some 700,000 young people reach working age every year in Uganda, only enough jobs for one in 10 are created,  according to the World Bank.  Poor basic services, corruption, expensive healthcare and overcrowded classrooms have also fuelled discontent in urban areas in particular. Museveni has not responded to criticism of his record,  instead accusing Wine and other opposition leaders of being “traitors”  who planned “insurrection … with their foreign backers”. At one rally, the president said that the protesters were “ being used by outsiders … homosexuals and others who don’t like the stability  and independence of Uganda”. Judith Nabakooba, Uganda’s minister for information, communications technology and national guidance, said that Museveni had guaranteed peace and stability “for so many years”. “He is a respectable leader. He has a full and wider view of Uganda, east Africa, Africa and internationally. He is tested. He knows where we have come from … and knows where to take us. To secure our future, we really need to support President Museveni,” she said. Though Museveni is expected to win the contest, the former rebel leader is likely to emerge weakened, and the poll may usher in a period of instability in Uganda. The former British colony has never had a peaceful transition of power, and previous elections have been marred by allegations of vote buying,  rigging  and  fraud . Wine said that “when people turn up in huge numbers and vote, there will be no way the regime can try to alter the voice and the will of the people”. Analysts have expressed concerns about democracy across eastern and southern Africa in recent years, although they say the picture is as varied within these regions as it is across the continent. The recent election in Tanzania was  marred by widespread repression,  while crackdowns in Zimbabwe have led to journalists and political activists being jailed for months without being found guilty of any offence. In Malawi, however,  Lazarus Chakwera  won power in a fresh poll after the judges overturned a 2019 election amid allegations of fraud. Patience Akumu , a Ugandan journalist and analyst, said officials’ claim that only Museveni could guarantee security was unfounded. “I think it tells us how flimsy the existing security is, if it relies on one man. The strongmen of the continent are falling one by one, and Museveni will go eventually,” Akumu told the  Observer . “Uganda, Africa, must face this fact.”
Nigeria cattle crisis: how drought and urbanisation led to deadly land grabs:	In February last year, Sunday Ikenna’s fields were green and lush. Then, one evening, a herd of cattle led into the farm by roving pastoralists crushed, ate, and uprooted the crops. “I lost everything. The situation was sorrowful, watching another human being destroy your farm,” says Ikenna, a father of 10 who farms in Ukpabi-Nimbo in Enugu state, southern  Nigeria . “I farmed a smaller portion this year because I am still scared of another invasion.” Ikenna’s experience is not an isolated event. In the past few years there have been a growing number of skirmishes between farmers and cattle herders searching for pasture and water. For many years the clashes were problematic, but the two groups usually managed to reach a mutual accommodation. But in the past two decades, the climate crisis has contributed to altering that old order, and what used to be a friendly arrangement has become a crisis marked by looting, raids, cattle rustling and premeditated killings. In 2016, Ukpabi-Nimbo, Ikenna’s community, was attacked, allegedly by cattle herders, resulting in the death of 46 people, according to one local media report. “Nimbo will never be the same after that morning,” Ikenna says of the attack. At the root of the crisis, according to experts, is Nigeria’s teeming cattle population, which has more than doubled from an  estimated  9.2 million in 1981 to  around 20 million , making it one of the world’s largest. Nigeria’s human population has grown too, to about 200 million, the highest in  Africa  by far. This has led to cities sprawling ever larger and wider, in some cases into formerly designated cattle routes and reserves. Routes that dated back to the 1950s, in line with colonial arrangements, have either been overrun or dominated by new human settlements – pushing herders further into contested territories. Grazing space that should accommodate only 10 cattle is now being grazed by 50 or more In rural communities, smallholder farmers are claiming large swathes of grazing land. “It means that grazing space, for example, that should originally accommodate only 10 cattle is now being grazed by 50 or more,” says Ifeanyi Ubah, a cattle rancher based in eastern Nigeria. Nigeria is, moreover, a crossroads for cattle from other countries: transhumance migrants from Cameroon, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad routinely pass through in search of better climate, pasture and more plentiful water. Though there are fewer than 100 official border crossings into the country, Abba Moro, an ex-government official who headed the ministry of interior, was quoted as saying that there  were more than 1,499 illegal entry routes  into the country as of 2013. Terrorist groups have become involved in the situation. Boko Haram has been accused of using money obtained from the sale of rustled cattle to fund its deadly operations. On one occasion, Boko Haram militants killed 19 herders as they attempted to steal their cattle. A rising number of attacks has led to the  reported loss  of two million cattle and the death of 600 herders, many of whom have been forced to vacate the fertile Lake Chad basin in search of new lands. But the climate crisis is the biggest factor driving tensions. Most parts of northern Nigeria have suffered severe desertification and drought. Mean annual rainfall in this region has  dropped below  600mm, compared with 3,500mm in the south coast area.  This change threatens the livelihoods of around 40 million people,  especially livestock and smallholder  farmers. Large numbers of cattle herders are being forced to move from traditional grazing areas to central and southern Nigeria when dry periods start – a situation that heightens competition and heralds more clashes. “While growing up, I saw trees, forest, rivers and streams in most parts of northern Nigeria. The grasses grew and it was more than enough for the cattle,” says Bala Ardo, one of the leaders of cattle herders in south-east Nigeria. “But it’s no more. The situation has forced the average herder to seek pasture and water in places they never would have visited in the past, as he struggles to find drinkable water for himself and family and then his animals.” The government, meanwhile, has only taken piecemeal action. In 2018, the federal government proposed  colonies for cattle  and funded grazing camps across various states in the country. But local leaders were resistant, and fears grew in the south in particular that ethnic groups such as the Muslim Fulani would use the scheme to  grab land . Some researchers  estimate  that the members of the Fulani ethnic group own 90% of Nigeria’s livestock.  As the climate crisis continues, the government has set up the National Livestock Transformation Plan, which aims to modernise the livestock sector through a series of phased interventions from 2018 to 2027. Ranches for breeding and processing will be created, and several pilot projects have already been established. But this plan, too, is encountering difficulties. According to Khalid Salisu, a journalist in one of the pilot project regions, “It doesn’t serve the needs of cattle herders adequately. The herders in the ranches are struggling to find enough water and pastures to keep their herds alive during the dry season.” In the absence of effective solutions from the central government, states and communities are proposing various remedies. In Benue state, southern Nigeria, for example, legislation in 2017 banned open cattle grazing. The law required herders to rent or buy lands to host their ranches. The heart of the problem is the need to persuade herders to give up treating land and water as a free resource. It will be difficult to persuade them to move to capital-intensive ranching, said Ubah. The herdsmen, for whom the policies are meant, should be directly involved Abubakar Sambo, the leader of the northern community in Enugu state, says the herders must be consulted before fresh initiatives are launched. “The policies received by cattle herders largely on radio and television cannot work. The herdsmen, for whom the policies are meant, should be directly involved.” He believes younger herders need to be educated and sent to study model ranching systems in other countries. “What the herders have achieved [cattle population growth] despite all the challenges is remarkable. It shows the huge potential of the livestock sector,” says Ardo. “Imagine what the result could be if the government put the right structure and policies in place.” Sign up for the  Animals farmed monthly update  to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

Bobi Wine confronted by Ugandan police during appeal for ICC inquiry:	Police in  Uganda  have confronted the presidential candidate Bobi Wine during an online press conference where he announced a petition to the international criminal court to investigate rights abuses in the country. During the meeting with journalists on Thursday evening, a week ahead of tense elections in Uganda, officers appeared to haul Wine from a vehicle while he pleaded: “I am not even allowed to park on the side of the road.” Wine said police fired live rounds and teargas and arrested his campaign team in the latest episode of  an escalating crackdown  on him and his team by state security forces ahead of the elections. In a defiant statement posted on Twitter, Wine said his battle to unseat the Ugandan president,  Yoweri Museveni , would continue. “Today they arrested all the 23 members of our new campaign team & impounded the cars. They thought they had broken our back,” he wrote. “The wave is unstoppable! #WeAreRemovingADictator.” The God we serve never sleeps! Today they arrested all the 23 members of our new campaign team & impounded the cars. They thought they had broken our back. I literally went to Namayingo alone. But this is how we were recieved! The wave is unstoppable! #WeAreRemovingADictator   pic.twitter.com/uMv17SCWcq The confrontation played out hours after  the deadly riot in the US Capitol  led to questions about whether some governments would be emboldened to push back harder against people invoking democratic ideals like fair elections. Wine has drawn the ire of the 76-year-old Museveni, who has governed Uganda since 1986 and who he has repeatedly branded a dictator. The president retains strong support in Uganda, with decades of economic growth and subsidies winning him a mass following, particularly in rural areas. Yet Wine’s campaign has galvanised staunch opposition to Museveni, and his stand against an old ruling elite and inequality has inspired young people in urban areas, and many across the continent. In response to a strong challenge to Museveni’s rule, Uganda has experienced its worst political violence in a generation and there have been repeated arrests and attacks on opposition figures. Hours after Wine announced his candidacy in November, he was arrested, and  more than 50 people were shot dead by security forces  in the protests that followed. Those deaths form a critical part of Wine’s petition to the ICC to investigate alleged acts of torture, mutilation and murder of civilian protesters. The petition by Wine and two other alleged torture victims mentions Museveni, the security minister Elly Tumwine, and other security officials. Wine was a popular singer before he won a seat in parliament and attracted national attention as the beret-wearing leader of a movement known as People Power. In December, Wine  said one of his bodyguards was killed by military police  who ran him over as Wine’s convoy was taking a wounded journalist to seek medical help. Military police denied involvement, saying the bodyguard had fallen from a speeding car. Last week  Wine told the Guardian  in an interview that he is forced to wear a bulletproof jacket, describing the campaign as “like a war and a battlefield”. “The regime is after our lives. It’s after hurting and incapacitating us. Every day we live is as if it’s the last one,” he said. Authorities have clamped down on opposition rallies,  stating they are in breach of Covid-19 restrictions . Last month the government wrote to Google, asking it to shut down 14 YouTube video channels that often host opposition figures because it said they had incited riots. Fears have also grown that the internet could be shut down on election day, 14 January, after similar moves in the last election in 2016. The Associated Press contributed to this report
:	W hat worries Bill Gates most? The booming population of Africa looms over his foundation’s  latest global survey . By the end of this century there will be 4 billion more people on Earth – and 3 billion of these extra souls will be born in Africa. The challenge, he says, is that “Africa must almost quadruple its agricultural productivity to feed itself. That’s very daunting.” The philanthropist is torn between sending out a message of hope and a message of fear when I meet him at his foundation’s spacious campus in the heart of his hometown, Seattle. He is reaching for what works best to revive the west’s faltering conscience in the face of “America first” nationalism and rising pull-up-the-drawbridge populism in Europe. The spirit of generosity is under assault as government aid budgets  come under constant sniper fire  from right-wing politicians and their media. Half of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation spending goes to Africa. The funds put into the foundation by themselves and fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett now amount to more than than $50bn (£38bn). Until last year Gates, the Microsoft founder, was the world’s richest man. He has now been  overtaken by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos . Gates’ first instinct is optimism. Just consider the astonishing story of how far and how fast people have been brought out of abject poverty in a very short time. Since 2000, a billion people have been taken well over the line of $1.90-a-day wretchedness (£1.45), with the same uplift among those previously living on $3.20 a day. The foundation’s report bursts with remarkable data – too few people know about the galloping progress of humankind. Take India, where only 18 years ago almost one in five children were not enrolled in primary school – now, 97% attend classes. Look at the indicators on the report’s global scorecard for the UN’s  sustainable development goals  for 2030, and most things are improving almost everywhere. But there is a marked variation in the future trajectory: progress depends on the level of future investment. Today, the west takes some persuading that things are getting better, especially in Europe where countries like Britain have suffered a decade of falling real living standards and eye-watering austerity. The upbeat message of Gates – as well as those in his late friend Hans Rosling’s book  Factfulness , and Steven Pinker’s  Enlightenment Now  – telling us most of the world is on an unprecedented upswing, jars with our reality. Yet it is so: the world has never seen such a rapid rise in prosperity among most of the poor. Eager to encourage western countries to keep giving aid, Gates is well aware that Britain – as elsewhere – suffers frequent political attacks on its aid budget. The UK, Sweden and Norway are among the few reaching the UN aid spending target of  0.7% of gross national income , and all feel the cold blast of an anti-foreigner political grudge. “If you are saving lives for a very small amount of money, people should feel good about that,” Gates says emphatically, protesting at current cynicism about international aid organisations. Look what can be done, he keeps saying, pointing as an example to the brilliant education system in Vietnam, a poor country whose results outstrip far richer ones. If Britain needs encouragement, he says, “the data about the impact has been amazing. The UK has been very generous to the vaccine fund, for two miraculous vaccines – one for pneumonia, one for diarrhoea.” These sicknesses are now preventable “at extremely low cost to all the children of the world. The UK led that effort and saved over 10 million lives.” Do people across the UK know that? He admits a failure to spread the good news. “We’re being challenged to explain.” Everyone should know this message of hope. “We’re talking about uplifting the human condition in a fairly dramatic way.” But if hope doesn’t beat the new nativism infecting the western world, then fear is Gates’ ammunition of last resort. Ignore Africa at your peril. “The stability of  Africa  makes a huge difference to the entire world.” Here come the threats: “A pandemic like Ebola can spread very fast,” he warns, and many others spread even faster if there are no local health services to contain them. Migration is the other threat to touch Europe’s politics. Syria was a small country, he reminds us, yet its civil war exodus has “challenged the asylum system”. But watch out because “Africa is another order of magnitude”. The huge African youth boom is a strong theme in the report, where in a world of ageing and shrinking populations, Africa’s demographic bulge could be an asset or a threat. So it would be wise “to make their lives attractive” not just out of “pure human caring”. Invest in Africa’s young, their human capital, health and education, support more productive agriculture, protect subsistence farmers against climate change and see how self-interest blends with good works. Africa, he always stresses, is not one country. Of its 54 nations, many are leaping ahead, Ghana, Botswana and Rwanda among them. Those causing concern are the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria. On his recent visit he warned Nigerians against the country’s growing inequality, where oil wealth for a few is leaving millions behind. The foundation has spent $1bn so far on Nigeria. He says: “Their health system is worse than poorer countries, their agricultural advice largely broken down.” Government resources are low because “their level of taxation is one of the lowest in the world”. He sounds puzzled: “You would think politicians would compete on the basis of, ‘Hey, I’m going to run a primary health system really well, I’m going to get vaccination coverage up, I’m going to save lives …’ But other issues about religion and ethnicity come to the fore.” Gates is something of a political naif. After all, I point out, look at us in the west. Look at the gross and rising inequality in the US and UK, look at the need for better public services, yet politics is all too often about culture wars and identity issues – Brexit for us, guns and abortion for America. Look at the problem of homelessness, with tent cities on the streets of his rich Seattle, a most liberal city, where only 8% voted Trump. Yes, he’s trying to help the homelessness crisis: he gives £350m a year to US causes. So we reachthe great blond elephant in the room, President Trump, who has  stopped funding family planning organisations  that also offer abortions , stalling access to contraception where women need it most. Trump also attacked the foreign aid budget, but “fortunately the Congress, including a lot of Republicans, said no”. How much can Gates influence him? Here, he steps with the caution of a barefoot man crossing broken glass, anxious to say nothing that could further imperil America’s aid budget. “We have to work with Trump himself and the whole administration on ‘What is your vision for Africa?’ And as a human being who cares about human beings, as a country who doesn’t want to go fight foreign wars or deal with pandemics that are out of control …” Did that pitch work? What helped was the famous warning of Trump’s defence secretary, General James Mattis, that soft power – state department diplomacy and aid – prevents the need for hard power: “If you don’t fully fund the state department then I need to buy more ammunition.” Is Trump persuadable? Gates pauses to pace a cautious reply: “Yes, one of the things you can say, a plus or minus, is in very few areas does he have a fixed ideology. If there’s something where he feels he can look smart … particularly if it’s doing things in a different way than was done before, then yes, I think he’s open-minded.” But the truth is that it would be hard to find two mega-wealthy men further apart in their view of the world, their mission or their morality than Trump and Gates. While Trump slashes tax for the rich, Gates constantly calls for the wealthy to be taxed more. “The fact that people aren’t for an estate tax [inheritance tax] is kind of mind-boggling to me.” He says creation of hereditary aristocracies dampens dynamism. “It’s amazing we allow people to have gigantic amounts of money when the state should take more of that.” He wants higher tax on corporate profits too. Famously, he boasts he has paid $6bn in tax, more than anyone on Earth, “and gladly so”. He sounds perplexed by the forces of darkness that fail to see the need for equality at home and globally, that oppose redistribution through taxes and that sneer at the spirit of philanthropy. Surely, he says at the end of our interview, “the improvement in the world is something people should be excited about”.

China tightens curbs as cases surge; Denmark restricts all travel – as it happened:	A quick recap of what has happened in the past few hours: We will be closing off this blog soon. You can find our ongoing live coverage  here  and our new blog  here . Viral fragments of Covid-19 have been detected at a sewerage plant in south-east  Queensland . Fragments were  detected at the Redcliffe wastewater treatment plant yesterday,  in a sample taken from the plant earlier in the week. Queensland’s chief health officer,  Dr Jeanette Young , said: This does not mean we have new cases of Covid-19 in these communities, but we are treating this detection with absolute caution.  A positive sewage result means that someone who has been infected was shedding the virus. Infected people can shed viral fragments and that shedding can happen for several weeks after the person is no longer infectious. She added: Given the recent case of community transmission in Brisbane and the regular detection of cases in other states, I am urging anyone who feels unwell in the communities of  Clontarf, Deception Bay, Kippa-Ring, Margate, Newport, Redcliffe, Rothwell, Scarborough and Woody Point  to get tested and isolate ... If there is a case we are not yet aware of, it is critical we detect it through our testing mechanisms as quickly as possible to contain any potential spread. Australia ’s federal opposition leader,  Anthony Albanese , says he will be discharged from hospital in Sydney this afternoon. He spent the night in the Royal Prince Alfred hospital after a car accident in Marrickville yesterday. Will be discharged from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital this afternoon and continue treatment as an outpatient- thank you for all the good wishes and a huge thanks to the paramedics, police, doctors, nurses, orderlies, radiographers and other hospital staff - you are the best Back in  Australia , Labor’s Indigenous affairs spokeswoman,  Linda Burney , senator  Patrick Dodson  and  Warren Snowden  have said  a consultation report on creating an Indigenous voice to government  “fails” because the models it proposes would not be able to provide full and frank advice, and be protected against abolition. In a joint statement, they said:  Labor thanks members of the advisory groups who worked on this interim report under difficult circumstances. Many will be disappointed with the government’s refusal to consider a constitutionally enshrined voice to the parliament. Three and a half years ago, First Nations leaders clearly expressed our desire for a First Nations voice to the parliament enshrined in the constitution – through the Uluru Statement – while the government banned its advisory group from even considering this. It is also difficult to see any progress being made before the next election. It is critical to real and lasting progress for First Nations people that we have a say in the policies and laws that affect us. A voice must be able to provide full and frank advice. It must be secure and it should not be subject to the whims of the government of the day. This report fails in that context. Labor remains committed to all three elements of the Uluru Statement: a constitutionally enshrined First Nations voice to the parliament; a Makarrata Committee to oversee a process for agreement and treaty-making; as well as a process for Truth-telling. Mainland  China  reported 33 new cases of Covid-19  on Friday, down from 53 on Thursday.  Most of the cases were in Hebei province, where a coronavirus cluster has grown by more than 130 cases in the past week.  From Reuters: T he National Health Commission said in a statement that  14 of the 17 locally transmitted infections were in Hebei , the province surrounding Beijing which entered a “wartime mode” this week as it battles a new cluster of coronavirus infections. Shijiazhuang, Hebei’s capital, announced on Saturday it would suspend service on its subway . Earlier this week, authorities banned people from leaving the city in an effort to curb the spread of the disease. Shijiazhuang is launching mass testing across its population of 11 million. On 8 January, municipal authorities told residents they must stay home for at least seven days even after they complete a nucleic acid test. The commission also reported  38 new asymptomatic cases, down from 57 a day earlier .   China does not classify these patients, who have been infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease but are not yet showing any Covid-19 symptoms, as confirmed cases.  Speaking of cases of the UK variant in  Australia , New South Wales authorities have released a statement saying a woman who was carrying that strain, and was released from hotel quarantine on 5 January after completing an isolation period and going 72 hours without any symptoms, was  not infectious when she returned to the community . They said: The person had been medically assessed the day before, met all exit criteria in place at the time, and on the basis of those criteria were considered clear of Covid-19. On the 7 January, genome sequencing found the person had been infected with the new UK variant of Covid-19. As a precaution, the person was immediately contacted by NSW Health and asked to isolate for retesting.  The person returned a positive test with a high CT value, which indicates low levels of infection, and returned to the Special Health Accommodation . This person attended several venues in Burwood in Sydney’s inner west on 6 and 7 January, which, as a precaution, were included in a public health alert released by NSW Health on Friday night. The person has one household contact who has tested negative to date. The full list of NSW exposure sites is  here . The  UK variant of Covid-19 has been detected in a case at the Howard Springs quarantine facility in the Northern Territory  in Australia. It’s the first time the variant has been detected in the NT. It has also been detected in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria.  Genomic sequencing revelled that a 26-year-old woman, who arrived at Howard Springs on an Australian government repatriation flight on 30 December and tested positive to Covid-19 on 31 December, was carrying the variant. The NT government said the woman remains under the care of health officials and under isolation.  Passengers and air crew on the same flight have been tested twice already with no positive cases resulting, and will be retested today.  China has announced fresh lockdowns in Hebei province, which borders Beijing, in a bid to stamp out a resurgence in infections before Lunar New Year. From AFP: Two Chinese cities south of Beijing further tightened virus restrictions Saturday  as authorities race to stamp out a resurgence in infections. China has largely brought its domestic outbreak under control after the coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019 – but a spike in Hebei province, bordering Beijing, has sparked fresh lockdowns ahead of the Lunar New Year next month. Hebei has reported over 130 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the past week, with more than 200 more asymptomatic infections. Most of the cases were in Shijiazhuang city, which along with its surrounding areas is home to 11 million people. Several other infections were reported in neighbouring Xingtai city, home to 7 million. Shijiazhuang suspended subway operations from Saturday morning to aid “prevention and control of the outbreak”, authorities said. Major highways leading into the city, around 300km (200 miles) south of Beijing, have already been closed and inter-city passenger travel halted. Overnight, Xingtai announced a week-long stay-at-home order to residents in order to curb its outbreak. The curbs come ahead of the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions criss-cross China to visit family and friends, with National Health Commission vice-minister Zeng Yixin warning Saturday the festival “will further boost the risk of transmission”. Authorities are racing to roll out vaccines, with more than 9m doses given so far, Zeng added. Health authorities recently gave conditional approval to a vaccine candidate by Chinese pharma giant Sinopharm, with emergency use jabs already administered in the later part of 2020. Health authorities in  Victoria, Australia , have added one new potential exposure site in Melbourne. Anyone who attended  Block 7 Dumplings in Ringwood on 29 December from 8.10pm to 8.45pm  has been advised to monitor themselves for symptoms and get tested and isolate should they appear. You can read the full list of Victorian exposure sites  here . T hree people in Queensland have been fined for not wearing a face mask , after face masks became mandatory in greater Brisbane at 6pm last night.  Police handed out “hundreds” of free masks in greater Brisbane on Friday night, the Queensland police deputy commissioner,  Steve Gollschewski ,   told reporters today. On three occasions those persons were actually offered the masks, refused to wear them, offered again and were given directions to go home because they shouldn’t have been out. Police were left with no alternative but to take enforcement action, which they did. A fourth person was fined for being in an unauthorised area, and all were hit with a $1,334 fine for failing to comply with the chief health officer’s directions. Future fines for failing to wear a mask will be $200, but Gollschewski said infringement notices were not yet ready to be issued. Police are handing out masks rather than fines – our officers have 40,000 masks that they can hand out, so I think they’ve got plenty. But we need the community to listen to the messaging and if the police officer engages with you and says, ‘You need to put this mask on’, you need to put the mask on, so it is a pretty good deal. Australia ’s chief nursing and midwifery officer,  Alison McMillan , has just given a coronavirus update in Melbourne.  She spoke about the new guidelines from the Communicable Diseases Network Australia, which I’ve mentioned a few times today, on getting rapid genomic testing for positive cases in hotel quarantine, extending the required isolation period to 14 days, and getting an exit test. The  United States has  set a new daily record for new coronavirus cases , with 290,000 cases reported in 24 hours, according to the Johns Hopkins global tally. Some 3,676 people in the US died with the virus in the same period.  There have been 21.8m cases and 368,685 deaths in the US since the pandemic began. Mexico has reported 14,362 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 1,038 deaths .  It is one of the highest daily case increases and brings the total number of cases in Mexico since the pandemic began to 1,507,931, with 132,069 deaths. The real number of infected people and deaths is likely significantly higher than the official count, the health ministry has said.  Coronavirus  border restrictions are  also causing problems at the border between South Africa and Zimbabwe . Zimbabwe has reintroduced movement restrictions following a surge in Covid-19 infections, which have doubled to 18,000 cases since the start of November. South Africa is the worst-affected nation in  Africa , with more than 1.17m infections and 31,800 fatalities since the pandemic began and unprecedented daily figures of more than 20,000 cases reported several times this week. More on this from AFP: Zimbabwean truck driver  Wallace Muzondiwa  queued four days in his vehicle to enter neighbouring South Africa after thousands of people rushed to the border to escape new Zimbabwean movement restrictions this week. The surge overwhelmed immigration authorities at the Beitbridge border post, South Africa’s second-busiest entry port, where angry crowds were stranded by the backlog. “The situation is very, very, very hectic,” said Muzondiwa, desperate to get back on the road after officials finally approved his coronavirus test and additional pandemic-related paperwork. “The line is going very, very slowly and the sun is very hot,” he complained. Flustered travellers hurried past with their luggage, hopping into minivan taxis parked alongside sizzling barbecue stands selling chicken wings on the go. Coronavirus has complicated cumbersome land border crossings in southern Africa, where trucks can sometimes wait days to get through sluggish customs. “What causes the delays at the borders are the documents,” explained South African driver Sinki Tshangise, 44, who has criss-crossed between Botswana, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe for almost a decade. Negative Covid-19 certificates often expire before arrival, he added, forcing drivers to pay for more testing on the road. “I don’t think I can afford to pay at each and every border,” said Tshangise. “It’s a real struggle.”
Iran bans importation of Covid vaccines from the US and UK:	Vaccines produced by the US and UK will be banned from entering  Iran , its supreme leader has said, even though his country has suffered the worst virus outbreak in the Middle East. “Imports of US and British vaccines into the country are forbidden ... They’re completely untrustworthy,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a live televised speech. “It’s not unlikely they would want to contaminate other nations. “Given our experience with France’s HIV-tainted blood supplies, French vaccines aren’t trustworthy either,” he added, referring to France’s contaminated blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s. Khamenei’s comments reflected the tense relations between Iran and the west, which have not abated in the waning days of Donald Trump’s presidency. In his speech, Khamenei mocked American democracy and human rights in the wake of  the riot at Capitol Hill in Washington , and said Iran was in no hurry to negotiate with the incoming Biden administration. But he said if the US lifted sanctions, Iran would respond. He said the issue of compensation for sanctions could be pursued at a later date. His remarks came as Iran prepared to discuss a plan to purchase medical supplies by unlocking as much as $1bn (£735m) of $7bn in frozen assets held in two South Korean banks. The plan will be discussed when the South Korean vice-foreign minister, Choi Jong-kun, travels to Tehran in an effort to secure the release of a   South Korean vessel  seized by the Iranian navy earlier this week . Some of the South Korean delegation reached Tehran on Friday. Iran’s central bank governor said Iranian oil revenues had fallen to $20bn, a drop of more than half, as a result of US sanctions. The Iranian foreign ministry claimed the diplomat’s visit was totally focused on the unlocking of Iranian assets, insisting it had been arranged before the ship seizure, although the official Iranian press has been reporting the US block on Iranian assets in Korea ever since the ship was stopped for allegedly polluting the marine environment. Tehran has been in lengthy negotiations with  South Korea  on how to access the assets held in South Korean banks without falling foul of US extraterritorial sanctions, something that is likely to happen if dollar transactions are involved. In the past Iran has exported oil and natural gas to South Korea using settlement accounts based on Korean currency. Owing to the imposition of US sanctions, Tehran has been unable to access its money, even though it insists the money could be transferred in South Korea currency and used exclusively for the purchase of sanction-exempt food and medicines. Seoul claims it has not received the necessary US Treasury assurances that the payments would not lead to fines. More recently, Iran has suggested the money would be used to buy vaccines using the UN-approved  Covax facility . Any payment via a dollar transaction might give the US Treasury leverage to fine the banks involved, and Seoul has said there is no safe way to transfer the money. In relation to the coronavirus, Iranian officials have previously said that importing the Pfizer vaccine, which must be shipped and stored at -70C (-94F), poses major logistical challenges for Iran. The country has struggled to stem the worst virus outbreak in the Middle East, which has infected nearly 1.3 million people and killed nearly 56,000. Iran launched human trials of its first domestic Covid vaccine candidate late last month.
‘It’s being built on our blood’: the true cost of Saudi Arabia’s $500bn megacity:	“The future has a new home,” proclaims the website. “It’s a virgin area that has a lot of beauty,” says the voice over a string section soundtrack as the  promotional video  tracks colour-tinted panoramic shots of picturesque desert expanses, and deep azure lagoons. “Better humans, better society,” it boasts extravagantly. The brainchild of Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman , the new city state of Neom, named from a combination of the Greek word for “new” and the Arabic term for “future”, is intended to cover an area the size of Belgium at the far north of Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea coastline. There has been no shortage of outlandish promises for the $500bn (£400bn) city-state. According to  strategy documents leaked last year , the project may include a huge artificial moon, glow-in-the-dark beaches, flying drone-powered taxis, robotic butlers to clean the homes of residents and a Jurassic Park-style attraction featuring animatronic lizards. Advertising materials stressed Neom will be built on “virgin” land, ready to be conquered with futuristic technology. “In 10 years from now we will be looking back and we will say we were the first ones to come here,” declares a Neom staff member featured in the video. Yet part of the site is the home of the Huwaitat tribe, who have spanned  Saudi Arabia , Jordan and the Sinai peninsula for generations, tracing their lineage back before the founding of the Saudi state. At least 20,000 members of the tribe now face eviction due to the project, with no information about where they will live in the future. “For the Huwaitat tribe, Neom is being built on our blood, on our bones,” says Alia Hayel Aboutiyah al-Huwaiti, an outspoken activist and member of the tribe living in London. “It’s definitely not for the people already living there! It’s for tourists, people with money. But not for the original people living there.” For some Saudis, the Huwaiti tribe among them, Neom, with its parallel legal system reporting directly to the king, represents an elite version of Saudi society, one designed simply to shut them out. Residents and visitors to the site will probably be allowed to drink alcohol and enjoy fine dining in a futuristic version of paradise that is also set to include a vast  data-gathering network , including drone and facial-recognition technology covering the entire city-state. The  death  of Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti on 13 April highlighted the tension between the tribe and the kingdom’s development plans. A resident of the town of Khuraibat, he had become the face of the tribes’ criticism of their forced eviction, voicing complaints in videos posted to social media, and appearing in others’ videos.  One  piece of footage showed him confronting a Saudi official who visited the town to speak with residents. Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti made one of his last  videos  in mid-April. “They have begun the process of removing people, beginning with surveying homes with the intent of removing people and deporting them from their land,” he said, referring to the security forces in his town. “They arrested anyone who said they’re against deportation, they don’t want to leave, they want to remain [in] their homes, that they don’t want money. “I would not be surprised if they come to kill me in my house now, and place a weapon next to me,” he added. Later the same day, he shot a video from his rooftop of the police down below. “See them? The police have come to get me,” he  said . Others from Khuraibat recorded  videos  of gunfire from outside his house. Later, they recorded  footage  inside his house, pockmarked with bullet holes. In a statement, the Saudi authorities  claimed  he’d been killed in a shootout with regional security forces, stating that Abdul Rahim injured two after he shot back. His supporters have described the shooting as “an extrajudicial killing”. So too have rights groups. “They killed him to set an example – anyone opening their mouth gets the same treatment,” says Alia al-Huwaiti. According to the Saudi rights group Al Qst, the authorities have  since  worked to cover up Abdul Rahim’s killing and placate the tribe. “They are hoping to pull off a major publicity stunt by getting prominent figures among the Huwaitat to publicly disown Abdul Rahim and ‘renew their allegiance’ to the king,” said the group. This was accompanied by the arrest of eight members of the tribe. For Alia al-Huwaiti, the killing of Abdul Rahim and the forced displacement of the Huwaitat people highlights the kingdom’s lack of care towards tribal communities long dominated and suppressed by the state. “MBS [Mohammad Bin Salman] began by telling the tribes: ‘We will develop your area, you will make money.’ They believed him at first. By 2019, they said ‘We will empty three villages, and force people to move,’” she says. “There is nothing called a tribe for Mohammed bin Salman,” she adds. “He doesn’t care about the tribes.” Alia said she has received death threats for posting about the plight of Abdul Rahim and the tribe on social media, including threats she has reported to the British police. The public relations team for Neom, as well as executives from the management consulting firm Teneo, hired by Saudi authorities  for  more than $2m  last year to represent the project, did not return requests for comment. The Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington DC did not respond to a request for comment. But Ali Shihabi,  a member of the Neom advisory board , told the Guardian that the displaced members of the tribe would be compensated. “Practice in Saudi has been that people have to accept it, and have usually done so because the government has a tradition of compensating generously.” He said he did not know how much members of the tribe would be compensated, or when. “We anticipated there might be problems, especially with as large of a land grab as Neom. It’s inevitable that there would be some kind of forced displacement happening,” says James Suzano, of the European-Saudi Organisation for Human Rights. “When the state has done this before, it was accompanied by human rights violations.” The destruction of communities on the Neom site follows decades of tensions between the House of Saud and the tribes it has ruled over since the creation of the Saudi state in 1932. Exerting control over the land through construction projects or destruction of some heritage sites have marked this rule. In 2017, the UN  condemned  the kingdom’s forced demolition of the walled city of Awamia, in the eastern Qatif region, as violating human rights. Karima Bennoune, the UN special rapporteur for cultural rights, said that “historic buildings have been irremediably burned down and damaged by the use of various weapons by the military, forcing residents out of their homes and of the neighbourhood, fleeing for their lives”. A $10bn King Abdullah financial district in Riyadh,  intended  as a “special zone,” has sputtered since its inception in 2006, weathering construction delays and confusion over its purpose, even after government attempts at a relaunch in 2016. Critics of Neom say the project risks the same fate. Construction is ploughing ahead despite the challenges of the pandemic and the  historic drop  in the price of oil, Saudi’s primary export. The project is part of the crown prince’s flagship Vision 2030 project, intended to diversify the economy away from oil, which has sustained the kingdom since the early 20th century. Yet the funds required to see Neom realised will inevitably require oil wealth. “It’s quite revealing that [Neom] is more of a vanity project targeting the domestic elite and an international audience in terms of a new Saudi, one that’s open and economically or socially liberal,” says Josh Cooper, of Al Qst. “But at the same time, not allowing the involvement of local actors or interests in these decision-making processes.” For Cooper, Neom is less a shining vision of the future than a grim symbol of Saudi human rights violations, underscored by the treatment of the Huwaitat tribe. “It shows the lack of platforms people have to express their opinions, even on less contentious matters than civil or political rights,” he says.
Barefoot in thorns: Gaza through the eyes of a Palestinian photographer:	W orking as a journalist in  Gaza , says Palestinian photographer Jehad al-Saftawi, is like walking barefoot in a field of thorns. “You must always watch where you step. Each neighbourhood is composed of its own intimate social network, and travelling through them with a camera makes you a significant suspicion. “You’re caught between the two sides of the conflict: the rulers of Gaza limit what you can photograph and write about, imprisoning and torturing those who disobey. At the same time, the Israeli army sees you as a potential threat that must be eliminated, as has been the fate of many Palestinian journalists.” The beach is the only place where Gaza’s nearly two million residents can feel a sense of space Now living in the US, Saftawi’s book My Gaza is a very personal account of an upbringing in a difficult and violent environment, with abuse from inside his own family as well as life in a conflict zone. “I’ve put my memories and dreams into these pages. I’ve shared the view from my window. Everyday scenes in Gaza: residents of Shuja’iyya carry what can be salvaged from their evacuated neighbourhood; one of the Rafah tunnels; flooding; waiting in line to fill up propane tanks “For years, I clung to the idea of fleeing my country for the western world. In 2016, I managed to leave Gaza for New York, and soon after began the process of seeking asylum in California. People wanted to know how they could help my wife and I, aside from offering financial assistance. Then I received the opportunity to publish my photographs. It’s an opportunity so many of the refugees arriving in the US every day aren’t afforded: the chance to share one’s experience. “My story is in part the story of my father, Imad al-Saftawi, who raised me with violence and fear, and who, after his 18-year imprisonment in Israel, was set free in December of 2018. An injured person is carried to the al-Shifa hospital. Civilians played a key role in transporting the injured during Operation Protective Edge “My parents cared for their children and wished us the best, but we were constantly berated. My siblings and I were made to feel guilty about our soft hands. We were threatened and punished if we didn’t go to the mosque for the five daily prayers. We were forced to wake at 5am to go with my father to pray the Fajr (dawn prayer). Young people have to make the most of their lives: playing on rubble; burning steel wool to celebrate Ramadan; rollerblading; celebrating Mohammed Assaf winning Arab Idol Palestinian protesters on Gaza’s eastern border with Israel, holding mirrors to force Israeli soldiers to witness themselves shooting and reflect sunlight to confuse their vision “I’m now seven thousand miles away from him, from Gaza, and I walk as a free man. A Palestinian shepherd tends to his sheep near the buffer zone in the northern Gaza Strip.

Making waves: the hit Indian island radio station leading climate conversations:	Selvarani Mari is a fisher and seaweed collector who lives on Pamban Island of Tamil Nadu, on the southernmost tip of  India . Every day she helps her husband cast the fishing nets, maintains rafts for cultivating seaweed, and dives into the ocean to gather sargassum. But she always makes time to listen to the radio. Mari, 33, and her friends and family all unfailingly tune into  Kadal Osai  on 90.4FM, India’s first local  radio station for a fishing community . With guests including from older people from the villages sharing their fishing wisdom or chatting about the climate crisis, the station has become an integral part of local life, featuring gossip, jokes, old songs and news on fish prices and sea conditions. Gayathri Usman, head of Kadal Osai, fell in love with the station when she visited the area, and stayed on to run it. “While a majority of the 12-member crew is from the same community, I am the odd one out,” she says. “Our shows are popular because they are entertaining, useful, and, more importantly, in a local dialect of Tamil that the fishing community understands and finds comfort in,” she says. Started by businessman Armstrong Fernando, himself from a fishing family, Kadal Osai (“the sound of the ocean” in Tamil) began in August 2016 with just a few hours of transmission daily, before going full-time in 2019. Alongside updates on weather, marine affairs and fish prices, advice on safe and sustainable fishing and the preservation of coral reefs, the station also conducts on and off-air workshops on the climate crisis and biodiversity. On the fringes of India’s mainland, across the water from Sri Lanka, Pamban and the surrounding 20 islands and coral reefs are part of the richly biodiverse  Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve , and home to 47 hamlets of the indigenous Marakeyars, engaged in fishing for centuries. “Due to poor signal reception, the fishing community cannot solely depend on the All India  Radio  [India’s national broadcaster], especially while at sea. In such a scenario, it is Kadal Osai – with a coverage area of 5-10km – that they tune into,” says Usman. In the past few years, the climate crisis has had a drastic effect on marine life and local livelihoods. Senthil Rajan is a microbiologist at a seaweed cultivation site in Pamban. “It has become increasingly difficult to predict and interpret water levels in the ocean, cyclone formations, and potential fishing zones. The erratic weather patterns have led to an unprecedented rise in sea levels as well as the height of the waves, thus affecting many seaweed cultivating sites,” says Rajan. “In such a scenario, tapping into the traditional knowledge of the fishing community, remains a rich source of learning.” Understanding this need to share knowledge with the next generation, Kadal Osai invites experienced fishers to talk with experts about the effects of over-exploitation on marine resources, and the importance of integrating traditional and modern fishing methods. “Using umbrella terms such as climate change and global warming with this coastal community may not drive home the point effectively. So, we juxtapose the knowledge passed down the generations with the right mix of anecdotes and scientific techniques and keep the dialogue going on climate change,” says Usman.  We keep the dialogue going on climate change Radio is one of the most powerful methods of communication in India, with enormous reach among its 1.38bn population. Even prime minister Narendra Modi has a monthly programme.  Unicef collaborated with 215 community radio stations in India, such as Kadal Osai, to create awareness around  ending child marriage,  something which has been on the decline in India, by 2030. “We started the ‘Kutty Chutty Express’ to inform children on the ill-effects of child marriages through skits, quizzes and roadshows, as well as conducting workshops,” says Usman. The station also publicises the number for  Childline India Foundation , which operates the country’s first 24-hour hotline for children in distress. During the pandemic, Kadal Osai has become a bridge between the authorities and the coastal communities. It created awareness of the importance of sanitising and social distancing, and also distributed free masks. “In the initial months, we tried to break a myth among islanders – who believed that they were safe from Covid-19, being surrounded by the salty sea water. Now, since the lockdown has been relaxed, we highlight that ostracising affected people isn’t the solution,” says Usman, as she signs off to go live on 90.4FM, and continue her mission to entertain and inform her faithful community of listeners.

'Not enough work, not enough money': can this Kyrgyz village survive without tourists? A picture essay:	I t has been over a decade since Umar Tashbekov saw his opportunity. His village, Sary-Mogol in  Kyrgyzstan , at an altitude of 3,600 metres, is close to   Lenin’s Peak, a popular mountain destination for tourists. If they were already hiking there, why not attract them to visit his village too? Sary-Mogol is a three-hour drive from the nearest city of Osh, in the country’s south-east. Life here is not easy – short summers and unfavourable growing conditions make it hard to grow much more than potatoes and barley. The main source of work is the large livestock market in town. Others find employment as teachers or in the nearby coal mine. Out of its 5,200-strong population, about 500 people have left for Russia where companies welcome factory workers. Clockwise from top left: A view of Lenin’s Peak and Sary Mogol village in south-east Kyrgyzstan; a girl carries bottles to fetch water in the village; clothes and other goods are sold at a weekly market, while men trade livestock An upside to traditional village life, with grandparents, parents and children all living together in the same small houses, has been the slow spread of Covid-19. Because homes are already crowded, people mostly meet up out in the street. That, and the overall government lockdowns, helped keep infection numbers low. Lake Tulpar-Kul, in the Chon-Alay mountains But if there has been limited impact on health, the impact on livelihoods is deep. In 2019, more than 1,300 tourists passed through Sary-Mogol. This year, it was fewer than a dozen. In the last decade, tourism has grown so that almost everyone here is connected to the industry in some way. Receipts from the export of tourism and travel services, which represented almost 6% of GDP in 2018,  have been forecast to almost disappear in 2020 . Revenues are predicted to fall by as much as 90%. Left: a sign indicates the yurt camp near Tulpar-Kel lake. Right: yaks roam in a field near the village Tashbekov opened the village’s first guesthouse in 2007, and invited other villagers to work with him. His company, CBT, soon became an “incubator” for the industry – almost everyone working in tourism has at some point passed through its doors. Soon after, he also opened the area’s first yurt camp, where tourists can stay in 12 traditional Kyrgyz lodgings out in the mountain valley. They enjoy the unique feel of the village – the old Soviet Uaz cars, the ancient  ulak  tartysh  horse game, the markets selling traditional crafts. The traditional sport of  ulak-tartysh  in the village of Taldy-Suu, near Sary-Mogol Then, Tashbekov’s son, Abdilla, took over the business. The 31-year-old has been a guide for more than 10 years. He built his own guesthouse, and was in the process of building a new one. He is always reading and researching on the internet, earning his reputation as the “studious” one. His vision has led to new ideas to develop the town and the family business. He and his father opened a bigger office, which serves as a gathering place for guides, workers and tourists. He organised ski training with other guides to move into winter tourism. In 2015, he had the idea to start the village’s horse and yak games festival and fair. The entire village attends, either as participants or spectators. Ticket sales bring in revenue for villagers working at the festival – cooking and selling traditional foods, performing traditional music and dancing shows, managing the yurt camp and competing in the games. Abdilla and his family have lunch at home in Sary-Mogol. Abdilla has been a tour guide for more than 10 years. He built his own guesthouse for visitors and initiated the village’s horse and yak games festival and fair. All of that momentum has been lost in the wake of the pandemic. Abdilla and his family have felt the economic pain. “The tourist season is dead,” he says. “We had to close the office, yurt camp and guest houses this year.” His wife works as a music teacher, and they are living off her income, with two children to support. “If tourism does not improve, I will have to go to Osh or some other place to look for work in construction,” he says. That might bring its own set of challenges: the construction sector may soon be another difficult area in which to find jobs. The UN development programme (UNDP), which this year has launched a set of measures to strengthen adventure tourism in Kyrgyzstan, published a survey that found  the most-affected sectors of the economy in Kyrgyzstan will be trade and consumer services and construction , each of which can expect 20% contraction.

He took over the business from his father in 2012 but coronavirus has stopped the flow of visitors Tashbekov’s other son, Ali, 23, began working in the family business at 13, before going to Osh to study logistics and welding. His training has come in handy during the pandemic. When the flow of visitors to the village stopped, he was able to find work as a mechanic in the mine. But he loved working with tourists, meeting people from all over the world. “It was a good time,” he says. “Sometimes I didn’t have time to come home. After [guiding] one tour, I immediately went with other tourists back to the mountains.” Ali Tashbekov has been working as a welder at the coalmine during the pandemic instead of in his usual role as a mountain guide. His wife Aizirek Avazova, pictured bottom, has had to stop working in the family’s guesthouse It was also a healthier job, he says, being outside in nature all day. Now he worries about the effects of the quarry gas he breathes in regularly. But as his wife worked in the now closed guesthouse kitchen, this is the only income they have. With his father recovering from a broken leg, a mother with Parkinson’s disease requiring expensive treatments, a one-year-old child and another on the way, the family’s resources are stretched to the limit. They are not the only ones feeling the strain in their village. Midinov Almazbek studied languages on his father’s advice, which allows him to teach English at the local school. During the summer, Almazbek also works as a guide. He took out a bank loan a few years ago to build a guesthouse, which he successfully opened, but in February he took out another loan to expand his business. He expected a normal summer, but with no tourists coming, he is now struggling to pay it back. Midinov Almazbek and his brother enclose their veranda with wooden planks in Sary-Mogol. Midinov is struggling to repay a loan he took out to build a guesthouse a few years ago “It’s been a hard year,” he says. “There’s not enough work, and not enough money.” Buunisa Termechikova, 58, also expected a normal summer. The entrepreneur opened a guesthouse and is skilled at crafts, especially the traditional Kyrgyz woman’s hat. Her new Ethnographic Museum, built by her son in July, is full of local products and historical artifacts. In the absence of foreign visitors, she is using the space for workshops for fellow villagers. Buunisa Termechikova opened the Ethnographic Museum in Sary-Molog in July. Since visitors dried up during the pandemic, she has been offering workshops in traditional crafts, such as making doll’s hair, to people living in the area But villagers here still play volleyball in the gym, and take part in horse games, held to celebrate events such as the completion of a new house or the birth of a baby. Maybe it is this energy and spirit that makes the village attractive to those who visit. Two years ago, a Korean engineer had such a good horse-riding holiday that he funded an initiative upgrading the water infrastructure so that villagers no longer had to carry water from the river. Everyone in Sary-Mogol looks forward to sharing their energy and spirit with visitors again.

Doctors demand government call out medical misinformation after acting PM says 'facts are contentious':	The peak body for Australia’s doctors has called on government leaders to call out medical misformation after the acting prime minister said “facts sometimes are contentious” when refusing to rebuke a controversial Coalition MP who has made unproven claims about Covid. The acting PM,  Michael McCormack , was on Tuesday accused of embracing Donald Trump-style post-truth politics after he declined to criticise Craig Kelly who said making children wear masks was akin to child abuse. Kelly has previously  championed the use of hydroxycholoroquine  to treat coronavirus despite  the most reputable global studies  finding it was ineffective as a treatment and could have  severe and even deadly side effects . The Australian Medical Association vice president, Dr Chris Moy, called on McCormack and Scott Morrison to counter misinformation from politicians, celebrities and others who were “torching the foundation of community health and science”. “Hopefully we can get the leaders being very strong and clear in their advice and strong about supporting science,” Moy told Guardian Australia. In the absence of that, he said, it was time to start “looking at other ways” of tackling misinformation such as the algorithms used by social media companies to show people content in their news feeds. “We need to do something about social media because some of that information is actually really perverting the foundational aspects of health and science,” Moy said. “The AMA tries not to get involved in politics, we really try to bring the community along with us by providing information which is above that political debate and to provide information that is trustworthy. “It is frustrating when there is information that is provided which is incorrect and is potentially dangerous to the public.” Both McCormack and Morrison have defended MPs right to “freedom of speech”. But Moy said “my concern is that free speech seems to include information that is false and not at all based on scientific grounds”. The medical association on Tuesday called on the Morrison government to invest in long-term and robust “online advertising” to counter health misinformation. “The internet has the potential to significantly magnify health misinformation campaigns, as people can easily absorb misinformation delivered directly to them through advertising, celebrity influencers, and people in positions of power,” AMA president Dr Omar Khorshid said in a statement. “We have seen this with the anti-vaccination movement, and the countless conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 pandemic that circulate constantly on the internet.” Kelly posted on his Facebook page at 1.40am on Tuesday that the results of a published study into mask-wearing by children during the pandemic showed the impacts were as bad as child abuse. “What other conclusion can be drawn from this first ever published study, other than that forcing children to wear masks is causing massive physical & psychological harm – that can only be defined as child abuse,” Kelly wrote. Australian health authorities generally have made exceptions for young children. For example, under the NSW mask mandate, authorities say children 12 years and under are exempt from wearing face masks “but are encouraged to wear masks where practicable”. Children under 12 are also exempt from Brisbane’s mask mandate and were exempt during Victoria’s mask mandate. The research by a German university found a range of impacts had been reported by children, including suffering headaches and being less cheerful, Kelly said. International health advice has repeatedly found mask wearing to be an effective way of controlling the spread of Covid-19. McCormack on Tuesday answered a question about Kelly spreading misinformation by saying: “Facts sometimes are contentious and what you might think is right, somebody else might think is completely untrue. That is part of living in a democratic country.” “You might look out there and say the sky is blue, and I could see from here it’s grey, but if we go out from under this rotunda, there are probably blue patches,” he told reporters in Townsville. “There are a lot of subjective things. I was asked about a colleague who puts material on Facebook, well some of what my colleague puts up on Facebook is very much true, but the people on the Twittersphere don’t like it. Toughen up I say. People have different views from time to time.” The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, told reporters in Melbourne that although “there’ll be very different views we listen to our medical advisers”. Instead of censuring Kelly, Hunt criticised commentators who had predicted more deaths and shortages of ventilators in Australia, estimates which did not come to pass due to restrictions to prevent spread of Covid. Asked about Kelly’s view that ivermectin was more effective than Covid vaccines, Hunt said: “I do believe the vaccine is necessary.” The Morrison government has previously  shut down attempts by Labor  to censure the controversial MP over his comments and Kelly stands by his advocacy for the drug. “I am not in favour of censorship,” McCormack said when talking about social media companies removing users or posts. “I am a former newspaper editor and journalists know that they have the right to free speech.” The Labor health spokesman, Chris Bowen, said “facts are facts” and Australia had “done well through this medical crisis because we’ve listened to the experts, the chief medical officers and the health officers and the TGA”. “Craig Kelly is a menace, and at every turn, Scott Morrison, and now Michael McCormack, the acting prime minister, have failed to call him out,” Bowen told reporters. The Greens said on Tuesday that Trump-style politics was “poison to democracy” and if this was the direction the Coalition was heading “it bodes terribly for the future of Australian politics”. On Tuesday evening, Liberal senator Gerard Rennick argued that only 909 Australians had died from Covid, less than the 4,124 who died from influenza and pneumonia in 2019, and he noted that no lockdowns had been imposed to fight swine flu. “Why is the Labor Party, the media [and] health bureaucrats imposing much harsher measures now given the severity of swine flu, rather than rely on the health system as they did back in 2009?” he said on Twitter. McCormack is acting prime minister this week while Morrison is on leave.
Leaders urge for more testing as mystery cases continue to emerge – as it happened:	With that, we’ll be closing the blog for today. Here is everything that happened: Federal Coalition senator  Gerard Rennick  has posted a series of tweets that question the risk of Covid-19, and the measures that the “Labor party, the media and health bureaucrats (are) imposing”.  “While all loss of life is tragic, I’ve put together some information to put some perspective around the impact of Covid.” While all loss of life is tragic, I’ve put together some information to put some perspective around the impact of Covid. In 2020, 909 people die from Covid and the median age of deaths to date in Australia from Covid is 86 years.  #auspol   pic.twitter.com/YnAcZCYx13 In 2019, 4,124 died from Influenza & pneumonia & the median age was 88.8 years. No border closures or lockdowns were imposed.  In 2009, under the then Rudd Government there were around 38,000 cases of Swine Flu & 191 reported deaths, including 41 deaths in  Queensland . The Queensland senator’s tweets follow acting prime minister  Michael McCormack ’s defence of Coalition MP  Craig Kelly  on Tuesday, who likened children wearing masks to child abuse, and who touted unproven Covid-19 treatments.  Why is the Labor Party, the media & health bureaucrats imposing much harsher measures now given the severity of Swine Flu, rather than rely on the health system as they did back in 2009? About 1,200 players and staff from all corners of the globe will be subjected to what the Victorian government has described as the “strictest rules for tennis” in the world when they fly into Melbourne for the  Australian Open  from Thursday. The tournament, which will  begin on 8 February after warm-up events that start on 31 January , is the largest international sporting event to be held in Australia since the beginning of the pandemic and in effect will broadcast the country’s Covid-19 response to the world. The Victorian police minister,  Lisa Neville , said on Tuesday players and staff would need to test negative for the virus before flying to Australia and then undergo 14 days of mandatory hotel quarantine. Quarantining players would be able to leave their rooms for up to five hours a day, but only to attend dedicated quarantine training venues set up at  Melbourne  Park, the National Tennis Centre and Albert Reserve. They will only be allowed to leave to train after a day two negative test, and players will be tested daily. All other staff and officials will need to remain in their rooms at all times for the 14 days of quarantine. Western Australia’s premier,  Mark McGowan ,   has stood by his comments that all states, including  New South Wales , should pursue a coronavirus  elimination  strategy. His comments follow criticism from NSW deputy premier  John Barilaro  on Tuesday morning, who demanded the WA premier “stop lecturing” his government on how to respond to community spread of Covid-19.  Later on Tuesday, federal agriculture minister  David Littleproud  also accused McGowan of trying to score political points in calling on NSW to pursue a Covid elimination strategy, while NSW premier  Gladys Berejiklian  said “anyone who thinks we’re going to eliminate or eradicate this disease, unfortunately, doesn’t appreciate what the pandemic means”.  On Tuesday afternoon, McGowan said: It is far better we don’t have the virus in the community in Australia. That is my position and I think that should be all states’ position.  If New South Wales says it is better to have it in the community than not have it, let it be their position. NSW Health has been advised of a new venue in the Northern Beaches visited by a confirmed case of COVID 19.  This information will be updated on the website shortly.  pic.twitter.com/uDoMEZVzCF What a way to catch Covid. I just received a positive COVID-19 test result after being locked down in a secured room at the Capitol where several Republicans not only cruelly refused to wear a mask but recklessly mocked colleagues and staff who offered them one. https://t.co/wVmgroKsdf Qatar Airways  says it will give priority to passengers flying home for compassionate and medical requirements and consider the “commercial value” of bookings in deciding which prospective travellers will be bumped from the flight list after hotel  quarantine caps for Sydney, Brisbane, and Perth were halved this week . The airline has resumed flights to Adelaide to increase the number of seats available on flights returning to Australia, but said it was looking at existing bookings for Sydney,  Brisbane  and Perth to fit in with the new quarantine caps. A spokesperson said: Qatar Airways analyses each flight based on a range of criteria, including compassionate and medical requirements, connecting flights, booking class, party size and commercial value. In order to ensure the continued viability of our operations to Australia commercial value of tickets sold must also be taken into consideration to be able to operate each flight. However, each passenger’s case is treated on an individual basis regardless of what cabin class they have booked. We have been assisting many passengers with emergency/compassionate issues as first priority to help them get on a flight home to Australia as soon as possible. We continue to work closely with all our passengers to find alternative flights if they are unable to travel on their original intended flight.” Qatar has run the most commercial flights to Australia of any airline since the pandemic began, ferrying 180,000 passengers.  The reductions to hotel quarantine numbers in  New South Wales , Queensland and WA were announced following national cabinet on Friday and will extend until at least 15 Febuary. Emirates  said it had also made changes to its flight schedule. A spokesman said: We are working closely with passengers on affected flights to minimise disruption as much as possible. In addition, Emirates, in conjunction with Embassies, Consuls and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), continues to assess compassionate and humanitarian grounds as a priority to assist passengers seeking to return to Australia on the earliest possible flights.” You can read the responses from other international airlines  here .

When the scientists on the  World  Health  Organization ’s mission to research the origins of Covid-19 touch down in  China  as expected on Thursday at the beginning of their investigation they are clear what they will – and what they will not – be doing. They intend to visit  Wuhan , the site of the first major outbreak of Covid-19, and talk to Chinese scientists who have been studying the same issue. They will want to see if there are unexamined samples from unexplained respiratory illnesses, and they will want to examine ways in which the virus might have jumped the species barrier to humans. What the mission will not be, several of the scientists insist, is an exercise in “finger pointing at China”. More from my colleague  Peter Beaumont: An  Australian Open  qualifier has been halted mid-match to tell a player he had Covid-19. Denis Kudla  was rushed into quarantine at the Australian Open qualifying event in Doha after testing positive for Covid-19. Fourth-seeded Kudla downed Moroccan  Elliot Benchetrit  6-4, 6-3 but the match ended in controversy.  Kudla’s positive Covid test result reportedly came through with Kudla leading 5-3 in the second and, according to Benchetrit, they had to finish the game in progress. Because world No 114 Kudla won that game, which wrapped up the match, he was declared the winner.  Had Benchetrit won the game to extend the match, it would have been declared a walkover in his favour. “At 5-3, they got the result. So to sum up: if I’d won that game at 5-3 to make it 5-4, I’d have qualified for the second round,” Benchetrit said on Instagram.  In another blow, Benchetrit may also have to isolate in Doha if he is deemed a close contact. The New South Wales premier,   Gladys Berejiklian , is “pleading” with people to come forward for testing after five cases of community transmission of coronavirus were identified in the state overnight, while in Queensland a man was in the community with an infectious UK strain of the virus for two days before going into isolation. As we see, the disease is still bumbling along in the community and we need to be vigilant about that. And that’s why I’m pleading for people to come forward and get tested. We know that it takes some time to completely get to the target of zero community transmission after there has been an outbreak, but it’s so critical that we raise those testing levels. There were 14,700 tests reported in NSW on Monday to 8pm, which the premier said was “not really enough for where we’re up to in the pandemic”. Of the five new cases included in Tuesday’s NSW numbers, two were announced on Monday: a man in his 40s who tested positive at Mount Druitt hospital emergency department, and his household contact.  NSW Health  are investigating the source of their infections. A further two cases were identified in the northern beaches and the source of their infections is also under investigation. The fifth case, a woman in her 40s, is  linked to the Berala cluster  and is a known close contact of someone already identified and in isolation. Berejiklian  said: Until we finish the mopping up, we don’t want another super-spreading event but the one restriction we want everybody to focus on at the moment is not having more than five people into your household on any given day, and please keep up the rates of testing. More than 31,000 permits to enter  Victoria  have been approved since the state launched its new “traffic light” system some three hours after border changes came into effect,  AAP  reports: The permit system wasn’t available on the  Services Victoria  website until about 8.55pm on Monday – despite the changes happening at 6pm. Among them was the introduction of a $5,000 fine for those arriving without a permit. The state’s emergency services minister,  Lisa Neville , on Tuesday apologised to Victorians who were unable to apply for a travel permit, describing the delay as “terrible”.  “There were technical issues of trying to get this set up properly, with Services Victoria working through some of the glitches to make sure it was working properly before it went online,” Neville said.  “A number of people absolutely were inconvenienced, frustrated and probably quite anxious as a result of that. I thank them for their patience and apologise for what happened.” She confirmed no one was fined as a result of the delays. “It is now working very, very smoothly: 31,000 people applied and have got a permit,” Neville said, adding it takes about five minutes to apply.  Under the system, regional NSW became an “orange” zone, meaning stranded Victorians can come home if they apply for a permit and get tested for Covid-19 with 72 hours of their return. Greater Sydney and greater  Brisbane , however, remain “red” zones. The  Royal Australian College of General Practitioners  has welcomed the  announcement from health minister  Greg Hunt  that GPs who wish to be part of Australia’s Covid-19 vaccination program will be invited to begin coordinating the  AstraZeneca  vaccine rollout from next week. RACGP president  Dr Karen Price , who appeared alongside Hunt at the announcement on Tuesday, said Australia’s vaccine rollout will be “a massive undertaking for our country” that and GPs will be “essential”. Price said: The majority of Australians go to their GP for their vaccinations and for many Australians they will do the same for their Covid-19 vaccine. General practice is well positioned to support the rollout – there are GPs living and working in communities right across our country, in cities, rural towns and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. There are many challenges ahead, including the need to build community confidence in the new vaccines through evidence-based information campaigns that address the community’s specific concerns and deal with misinformation and myths. At the announcement, Hunt said hospitals will be better suited to injecting the  Pfizer  alternative because that version of the vaccine must be stored at significantly colder temperatures. Last week, the government announced an accelerated rollout of the vaccine, bringing it forward to mid-to-late February. High priority groups will receive the vaccine first. Western Australia  has recorded one new case of coronavirus – a man who returned from overseas and tested positive while in hotel quarantine.  There are 14 active cases of Covid-19 in WA. Some more information on the  ACT’s relaxed entry conditions taking effect from 3pm today .  From 3pm today, the ACT Public Health Direction will be amended to remove the Central Coast and Wollongong from the list of COVID-19 affected areas in NSW.  The COVID-19 affected areas of Greater Sydney will also be reduced to 11 specific Local Government Areas (LGAs) 👇  pic.twitter.com/Dcb9wqMpZQ The Greens have called on  Michael McCormack  to apologise for using the phrase “all lives matter”, saying it is a “racist dog-whistle”. The acting prime minister has faced criticism for his comments comparing last week’s deadly  US Capitol siege  by pro- Donald Trump  rioters to last year’s  Black Lives Matter protests . Nick McKim , the acting leader of the Australian Greens, said in a statement issued a short time ago: Last year, the  Senate united to block Pauline Hanson from using this racist dogwhistle in Parliament.  Now, the acting PM is using it in press conferences to defend his own racist dismissal of black deaths in America.  Michael McCormack knows what he’s doing by using this phrase. He’s telling Australia’s racists that he is taking their side. He needs to apologise immediately. Rejecting calls from  Amnesty International  to retract the comparison of the Capitol siege to Black Lives Matter protests, McCormack told reporters today:  I appreciate there are a lot of people out there who are being a bit bleeding heart about this, and who are confecting outrage, but they should know that those lives matter too. All lives matter.” The federal opposition’s health spokesperson,  Chris Bowen , was also critical of McCormack’s language,  saying the acting prime minister’s apparent attempt “to diminish the Black Lives Matter movement was beyond disgusting”. Human Rights Watch ’s Australian director,  Elaine Pearson , has joined a chorus of outrage in response to acting prime minister  Michael McCormack  using the phrase “all lives matter”. 🇦🇺's acting PM now being deliberately provocative using the "All Lives Matter" slogan. What a cheap, divisive & dangerous political stunt.  https://t.co/MPOTZLqX2E We've just seen how political speech can fuel a deadly riot in Washington. We need our leaders to condemn those actions instead of parroting the language of far-right movements. The  Australian Capital Territory  will no longer require travellers from NSW’s  central coast ,  Wollongong  and parts of  greater Sydney  to quarantine upon arriving in the territory. However the ACT still considers the following local government areas in  Sydney  to be Covid-19 affected, and therefore requires anyone entering the ACT from the LGAs to quarantine for 14 days. The relaxations will come into effect from 3pm today. It will mean some people currently in quarantine in the ACT will be able to leave quarantine later today. 
I hear people say that people who receive Centrelink are lazy. Hello, I want to work!:	Name:  Madeleine Rose Age:  22 Dreams of:  Being a teacher After a festive, blissful few weeks celebrating Christmas and New Years, I am able to finally relax and reflect. I was able to spend so much time with my family, who I barely got to see last year. I’m just so thankful that Victoria managed to get our second wave under control and that I was able to have some time completely unafraid to catch Covid. Though with that being said, tribulations are still very much present in my life. I’m still without a job, despite applying for what seems like hundreds of roles. That is an exaggeration; I must admit the real number is about 70. I need a job which can work with my schooling. This means I have applied for a lot of retail and hospitality jobs, but nowhere is hiring. Even the cafe I used to work at isn’t hiring because they don’t have the demand. Applying for these casual jobs is not an easy process anymore. Each job application requires a cover letter, then they either have questionnaires or a 20-minute long test. Plus it’s incredibly hard to find organisations or employers willing to hire someone without two years’ experience in that field. I only have a few months of being a barista on my resume – but how am I meant to get experience? Am I supposed to volunteer for two years without getting money to live? I don’t know what to do. I don’t have anyone to “help” give me a foot in the door, or whatever the saying is. I have not received one email back, not one text or call stating if I have been rejected or been accepted to go for an interview. I feel like I’m constantly getting discouraged and whatever I do, I’m failing. It is so tempting just to quit trying to get a job. It would also be a lot less stressful. However I think of what the alternative, of not having a job, would mean and that thought is terrifying. I hear people say constantly that people who receive Centrelink are lazy and want to bludge off the system and don’t want to work. Hello, I want to work! I want to get a job and contribute to society again, but what am I meant to do if nowhere will hire me? Pre-Covid, I had a job and was studying at uni. Though it was tough and oftentimes exhausting, it felt great to know that I was being proactive. But now, I have nothing. Uni doesn’t start for another two months. How else am I able to chase my dreams? During all this I have noticed something truly bizarre. My eyesight is extremely poor and I can barely see how I used it to. I think this is one of the side effects of lockdown no one predicted. I mean, staring at a TV screen, iPad screen and phone screen for nine months straight has made my eyesight so poor that I definitely need glasses. Which is another expense I cannot afford at the minute. I haven’t seen an optometrist to get tested, partly due to being afraid to see the damage done to my eyes, and also stupidly, I’m worried about the expensive bill that I will get from it. So now I have to deal with my constant headaches and watch as things become more blurred in the background. I have also rapidly put on weight during lockdown. It is my own fault really. You would think that being at home 24/7 for nine months would give one time to work on their health, but that has not been the case for me. Not at all. I have ordered so much takeaway combined with not doing any exercise at all. This has definitely made me feel more incapable of doing the things that I used to before, like I’m struggling to walk to the bus stop or enjoying playing in the sand at the beach. Now more than ever before, I have to start prioritising my health, even if it inconveniences me. So now my new year resolution for 2021 is to get a job and be healthier. Hopefully 2021 is the year I can stick to my goals.
Oil and bitcoin rise, but US small business optimism slides – business live:	Oil is trading at its highest level in 11 months tonight, with Brent crude holding firm around $56.55 per barrel, up 1.5% today. Saudi Arabia’s plan to cut output in February and March is calming concerns that the ongoing pandemic will hurt demand, with lockdown restrictions likely to last many more weeks. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at  IG , says traders expect oil demand to rebound as the global economy reopens later this year. One rally that shows no sign of abating is that of crude oil, which has pushed to a new eleven-month high. Here at least the rationale for further gains seems more solid, given the long-term improvement expected in demand and the tight control exercised on current supply levels. The fact that oil prices have managed to weather the bounce in the US dollar with few losses points towards continued strong buying from institutional investors, confident that demand will rebound as 2021 goes on.  Britain’s stock market has closed lower for the second day running, despite the rising oil price lifting energy companies. The  FTSE  100 index has ended the day down 44 points or 0.65% at 6754. Multinational stocks did the damage, due to the impact of  the stronger pound on their overseas earnings . Pharmaceuticals group  Hikma  (-3.5%), specialist chemicals firm  Croda  (-3%) were among the fallers. But  BP  and  Royal Dutch Shell  gained around 2%, helped by  crude prices hitting their highest level since February today . Airline group  IAG  (+3.3%) and hotel chains  Intercontinental  (+2.8%) and  Whitbread  (+2.2%) also rallied. Other European markets had a quieter day, with the German  DAX  flat and France’s  CAC  dipping 0.2%. But after last week’s surge, the  FTSE 100  is still up 4.5% this year - with the Europe-wide  Stoxx 600  up 2.4%. Back in the UK, the John Lewis Partnership has suspended its click and collect services at its department stores, in an attempt to reduce non-essential travel and combat the spread of Covid-19. Its Waitrose supermarket is also now insisting that all customers must wear a face covering (unless medically exempt or under the required age).  This new approach will be rolled-out across all stores over the next few days, as  the NHS comes under increasingly severe strain  with daily cases around record levels. Marshals will be positioned at the entrances of all Waitrose supermarkets, equipped with disposable masks available for customers who do not have their own. Anyone who won’t wear one will be denied admission. Other supermarkets, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, have also  strengthened their policies on masks this week . John Lewis strengthening Covid rules: • Click & Collect services based within John Lewis department stores to be temporarily suspended • John Lewis in-home services will only be carried out if they are essential to customers’ wellbeing Also: “Partners in Waitrose shops will now be required to wear face coverings when behind protective perspex screens and in back of house areas.” Will other supermarkets follow? Many customers grumble about wearing masks when not all staff do. Job vacancies in the US have dropped, in another sign that the economy faltered last year. There were 6.527m job openings at the end of November, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, down from 6,632 in October.  That’s also a decline on a year ago, when there were 6.793m vacancies. With the number of new jobs falling in December, this JOLTS report highlights the economic damage caused by the escalating pandemic, which has also  killed 376,000 Americans so far . The JOLTS report also shows that layoffs and discharges rose during November, as firms were forced to cut staff due to Covid-19 restrictions. Here’s some expert reaction, from Heidi Shierholz of the thinktank  Economic Policy .  Further, layoff rose in October and November as the virus surged. Things are moving in the wrong direction.

Investors are juggling the threat of more violent clashes in the US, the prospect of more stimulus measures once Joe Biden is sworn in, and the possibility that a stronger recovery means the US Federal Reserve winds back its own ultraloose policy. Mark Haefele , chief investment officer at  UBS Global Wealth Managemen t, says vaccine rollouts should underpin the recovery: “While near-term fluctuations are likely, we think the greenback’s downtrend should remain intact as long as global recovery prospects stay in focus. We expect further COVID-19 vaccine rollouts to support an economic and earnings rebound that should see the global economy expand by more than 6% this year.”  Missing out on an asset rally can be annoying. But nowhere near as gut-wrenching as taking part, and then losing the money....because you’re forgotten a password. That’s the situation facing some early bitcoin holders who can’t unlock the digital wallets, reports  the New York Times today , because they’ve lost or forgotten the private key needed to access it. Here’s a flavour: Bitcoin owners who are locked out of their wallets speak of endless days and nights of frustration as they have tried to access their fortunes. Many have owned the coins since Bitcoin’s early days a decade ago, when no one had confidence that the tokens would be worth anything. “Through the years I would say I have spent hundreds of hours trying to get back into these wallets,” said Brad Yasar, an entrepreneur in Los Angeles who has a few desktop computers that contain thousands of Bitcoin he created, or mined, during the early days of the technology. While those Bitcoin are now worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he lost his passwords many years ago and has put the hard drives containing them in vacuum-sealed bags, out of sight. The future of money is losing $220 million because you can't remember what password you used 10 years ago  https://t.co/miZM2KwWyE   pic.twitter.com/c8haLkO2eL Back in 2013,  we covered the early bitcoin miner who accidentally threw away a hard drive holding 7,500 bitcoins , created before prices took off.  That drive, buried in a landfill site near Newport, Wales, was then worth over £4m. At today’s prices? Around £180m..... Here’s our news story on BoE governor Andrew Bailey’s concerns: The  Bank of England  governor, Andrew Bailey, has said the economy is in a “very difficult period” due the latest Covid-19 lockdown and it would probably delay the recovery. In comments on Tuesday that  echoed warnings from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak , a day earlier that the economy “is going to get worse before it gets better”, Bailey said it would bounce back, but only after the lockdown had ended and concerns about the spread of the virus had receded. “[We’re] in a very difficult period at the moment and there’s no question that it’s going to delay, probably, the trajectory,” he said.... Deutsche Bank  became the latest large company to cut ties with Donald Trump, with the firm that has propped up the Trump Organization for two decades reportedly announcing it would no longer do business with the disgraced president. The German bank’s move –  reported by the New York Times  – follows Wednesday’s  deadly attack on the US Capitol building  by a mob of Trump supporters. The number of corporations disassociating themselves from Trump is now turning into an avalanche. Deutsche Bank has been Trump’s most important lender. The Trump Organization, fronted by his two older sons, owes the bank about $340m in outstanding loans. After a series of bankruptcies in the 1990s, it was the only bank willing to give Trump money.... More here : Although Bitcoin is still looking much less volatile than yesterday, it is losing some of today’s bounce. It’s now trading around $35,000, a gain of $1,100 (or 3.3%) since last night, but still around 16% below last Friday’s record high.  It’s still up around 21% for the year, though, amid rising interest from some institutional investors. Matthew Cady , Investment Strategist at  Brooks Macdonald,  suggests cryptocurrencies could become the victims of their own success: Should cryptocurrencies succeed in becoming widespread in use, central banks, governments, and financial regulators are unlikely to sit by as they displace the role of existing fiat currencies such as  Sterling , Euros or US Dollars. A more likely scenario is that policy makers could introduce regulation which might at best heavily regulate their use. With monetary policy continuing to play such a critical role in economies and markets, especially so during the Covid-19 pandemic, policy makers are unlikely to give up such an important macroeconomic lever. Bitcoin has seen a significant amount of interest, perhaps matched only by the level of price volatility, even in recent days. As a new technology, the financial regulatory response is evolving all the time, and regulators are likely to continue to fine-tune the rules around what is and what isn’t allowed. As the use of cryptocurrencies is likely to continue to grow, it will likely force policy makers to continue to clarify how it can be used and traded. At the end of the day, the process of attempting to weigh up the pros and cons of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is no different an exercise to any other asset class, but the latest risks outlined by regulators are important to keep in mind. The slump in US small business confidence last month  partly reflects the fact that many small business owners are solid Republicans, analysts say. Here’s George Pearkes, macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group: You should be skeptical about parts of NFIB's data set. The December drop in reported conditions is entirely predictable based on the political biases of its respondents.  pic.twitter.com/l5CN54r9SN But while they may not have voted for Joe Biden, those firms are likely to benefit if the Democrats roll out a multi-trillion dollar stimulus package that pulls unemployment down faster. Edward Moya of OANDA explains:   The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index confirmed the December labor market weakness seen in last week’s nonfarm payroll report. The small business index plunged as expected given President Trump’s defeat (small businesses loved Trump) and all the stimulus uncertainty due to Georgia Senate runoff races, and rising lockdown risks that remained in December. Businesses had no idea we were going to see a Blue Wave and that vaccines targets would be boosted. Wall Street is looking beyond the NFIB’s headline index drop to 95.9 which brought it below the historical average of 98. Small businesses are expected to see more relief under a Biden administration and that should help the index rebound next month.  Back in the City, the  FTSE  100 has dipped deeper into the red as the pound rallies. The blue-chip Footsie index has now lost 45 points, or 0.65%, to 6752, away from the pandemic highs seen last week. Multinationals are suffering from the strength of sterling. It’s still up three-quarters of a cent at nearly $1.36 following BoE governor Andrew Bailey’s comments  about the ‘issues’ surrounding negative interest rates .  Fallers include pharmaceuticals group  Hikma  (-3.4%), consumer goods makers  Reckitt Benckiser  (-2.8%) and  Unilever  (-2.2%), and fluid engineering firm  Spirax-Sarco  (-2.1%). Over in the US, business confidence among small businesses has fallen sharply to a seven-month low. The National Federation of Independent Business reports that its small business optimism index slid to 95.9 for December, down from 101.4 in November. That’s a sharp fall, to below the long-term average (98.0), and the lowest since May. Small businesses reported that they are more concerned about their sales outlook and business conditions this year, as the pandemic hits the US economy. NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg says: “Small businesses are concerned about potential new economic policy in the new administration and the increased spread of COVID-19 that is causing renewed government-mandated business closures across the nation.”  #UnitedStates  NFIB Business Optimism Index at 95.9  https://t.co/HiGud1xCw3   pic.twitter.com/rRSOc0Age0 BoE deputy governor Ben Broadbent predicts that unemployment will rise as the UK government’s job protection schemes end this year. During  his speech , he also flags up that the economy will shrink this quarter, as well as in the last three months of 2020 - putting the UK back into an official recession: The lockdowns mean that, on a quarterly basis, GDP is likely to have fallen in the fourth quarter of 2020 and to do so again in 2021 Q1. This will no doubt prompt headlines about a “double-dip recession”. But this is quite unlike any normal economic cycle. Its size, shape and speed are all highly unusual. As far as medium-term inflation is concerned, what matters more than these gyrations in output per se – very large though they are – are developments over time in the labour market. The rate of unemployment is the best single measure we have of economic slack. It also affects households’ confidence about their income and is therefore correlated with rates of saving. And it’s because, unfortunately, we expect unemployment to rise once the furlough schemes are wound down (the MPC’s central forecast in November was for a peak rate of almost 8%, despite a sharp projected recovery in output as health risks fade) that the appropriate response has been to ease policy significantly.  Reminder: BoE governor Andrew Bailey warned earlier today  that the true unemployment figure is probably 6.5%, not the official rate of 4.9%, with the furlough scheme keeping many people in their jobs.   UK consumers’ willingness to switch spending from ‘risky’ to ‘less-risky’ activities has helped to cushion some of the economic impact of Covid-19, says Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent.  In a speech on Covid-19’s impact on consumer spending, Broadbent outlines how some of the money that would have been spent on restaurant meals, pub outings trips to sporting events was redirected. That money often went towards online shopping, takeaways, and products such as audio-visual kit for the home -- especially if it’s relatively easy to substitute old consumption with new. But conversely, households are more likely to delay spending rather than switch expenditure if they think the lockdown disruption is only temporary, Broadbent adds. Obviously we know that spending patterns were radically altered this year ( as Kingfisher’s strong sales figures showed this morning ). Broadbent’s analysis is that this divergence means there was less of a hit to inflation than one might think, and that big shifts in demand can push up costs (as the economy can’t instantly reshape itself).  He also flags up that the furlough scheme shielded household income from the drop in national income seen in the first half of last year. Spending by today’s consumers has in part been sustained and funded by tomorrow’s taxpayers. Here’s Broadbent’s conclusion: The pandemic, and the waves of the restrictions that have accompanied it, have had highly selective effects. They’ve hit some areas of spending much harder than others. The decline in aggregate consumer spending would almost certainly have been more protracted and more widespread – affecting not just activities that involve infection risk but those that do not – but for the furlough schemes. These have helped shield household incomes from the big drop in national income last year. But that’s not the only thing going on. Spending on some of these “non-risky” things have actually risen faster than incomes – in some cases faster than they have for many years. So it looks as though consumers used some of the money they would have spent on riskier activities – going to restaurants and so forth – to buy other things instead. This makes sense. A pound less spent on one thing needn’t mean a pound less in total. Indeed under some (admittedly extreme) conditions you’d expect substitution of this sort to be one-for-one. If people are entirely indifferent between different sorts of consumption – if they’re just as happy with “non-risky” as “risky” stuff – aggregate spending wouldn’t fall at all (for given income). What they saved on one would be spent in its entirety on the other. The same is true if a rise in infection rates is expected to be permanent. If the future looks exactly like the present there’s no reason for saving – or therefore total consumption – to change. These conditions are obviously unrealistic. Some things are good substitutes for risky activities during the pandemic. Perhaps it’s not much harder to buy things online than in a shop. At a stretch, watching a film on a screen at home can replace a trip to the cinema. But going out with family or friends to a pub or a restaurant, listening to live music or watching a play – for many of the things we’ve been denied for much of the past year, there is no good proxy. As for the dynamics of the pandemic, one thing they’re not is permanent or even slow-moving. Infection rates went up very rapidly in the spring and, once lockdown was in place, they fell almost as rapidly in the early summer. With the promise of looser restrictions as that happened, it would make sense for people to hold off on some spending until the day itself arrived. Nevertheless, it’s clear that a fair degree of expenditure switching took place: some areas of consumption fared unusually well last year, even as others declined extremely sharply. Because it’s hard for economic resources to respond to large and rapid shifts in demand this may have softened somewhat the immediate impact of the downturn, enormous as it was, on inflation.  Ben Broadbent today considers how household consumption has responded to  #COVID19  – both in the mix of spending, and spending over time – and how the dispersion of demand across sectors might have softened the impact of the downturn on inflation https://t.co/Q2YTbYPpMN   pic.twitter.com/m5X8O2orPe Short version of Ben Broadbent's latest speech: Britons bought BBQs rather than breaks to Benidorm in 2020:  https://t.co/dcA904QOEz Oil’s rally  is being driven by Saudi Arabia’s pledge last week to cut its crude output in February and March. This production cut pledge is protecting prices during the ongoing travel restrictions and lockdowns, which are likely to weigh on demand. Eugen Weinberg of Commerzbank says: Saudi Arabia in particular is ensuring through its additional voluntary production cuts that the market is undersupplied if anything. 
Vaccine scepticism in France reflects 'dissatisfaction with political class’:	I n  France , every child is now obliged to have 11 vaccinations. If parents want their children to attend school, or take part in many extracurricular activities, they must accept. There is no opt-out or concessions made to vaccine doubters. On Monday France’s government and health authorities are speeding up the country’s Covid-19 vaccine drive – a process complicated by widespread scepticism about the inoculation that has encompassed the usual global conspiracy theories. For weeks, polls have suggested up to 60% of French citizens do not wish to be vaccinated. As the government’s vaccine operation enters its third week,  official figures  show that as of Saturday at least 93,000 people had been given the jab – a much lower number than elsewhere in Europe, including the UK, Germany and Italy.  Laurent-Henri Vignaud, a science historian whose 2019 book  Antivax,  co-written with immunology specialist Françoise Salvadori, examines vaccine scepticism in the west since the 18th century, says we should not heed polls suggesting the French will refuse the vaccine. “There’s a very big difference between what the French say and what they do,” he told the Guardian. “And polls whose methodology and questions can seem abstract do not reflect what happens when people know where they will have the vaccine, what it does, the how, when and why.” Vaccine doubters have existed as long as vaccines , but for years polls have suggested France has more than most of its European neighbours – an odd reputation given that immunology pioneer Louis Pasteur was French and is a figure of fierce national pride. Prof Jocelyn Raude, an expert on health behaviour at the École des Hautes Études en Santé Publique who has studied the anti-vaccine movement, says that as recently as 2005 polls showed 90% support for vaccines, “which seems incredible today”. However, by the turn of the 21st century the seeds of doubt had already been sown. In the 1990s, a mass campaign to vaccinate French children against hepatitis B coincided with a jump in multiple sclerosis cases, though studies never found a convincing link between the two.  In 1991, there was a medical scandal not linked to vaccines specifically when it was discovered that health authorities had knowingly distributed blood products contaminated with HIV to haemophiliacs in the 1980s. Several ministers were later charged with manslaughter. However, Raude said it was the 2009 H1N1 scandal, in which the government massively overordered 94m vaccine doses at a cost of €869m (£780m), that fuelled today’s vaccine scepticism. The health ministry later cancelled more than half the order but the damage was done. Opposition parties criticised the waste of public money and accused officials of being in league with big pharma. In the end, 323 people in France died of H1N1, only 6m people were vaccinated and 19m vaccine doses were destroyed. An official estimate put the cost of the debacle at €382m. Raude says the scepticism was amplified when some high-profile French celebrities began expressing vaccine doubts, relayed by newly emerging social media networks. Then came the  Mediator scandal . The diabetic drug, widely but wrongly prescribed to those seeking to lose weight, was linked to between 500 and 1,200 deaths over more than three decades. Mediator’s manufacturer, Servier, was accused of charges including manslaughter, and 12 people ended up in the dock in a criminal trial last year, including officials who were also paid as consultants of pharmaceutical companies. The company and the individuals charged deny wrongdoing. Judgment is expected in March. “It was a tipping point. The Mediator scandal validated in people’s minds the idea of corruption between officials and pharmaceutical companies in France; that it was about business not health safety,” Raude says. Another cause, he says, is the lack of confidence in doctors and scientists. “It’s not new for the French to lack confidence in political leaders, but there is a low level of confidence in the medical authorities in France. The effect of this is if you don’t trust the experts, you don’t follow their advice.” Vignaud says vaccine scepticism is less against the vaccine itself than those promoting it, reflecting  a distrust of “politicians , high-profile doctors and experts and journalists”. “France doesn’t have any more hard and fast anti-vaxxers than anywhere else, what it does have is … a certain dissatisfaction with the political class,” he says. “There is a strong expectation of the state, but we are permanently disappointed: we see this with the vaccine programme: some say it’s too slow, others it’s too fast. Everyone is disappointed.” The  film Hold-Up , a much lampooned and debunked epic claiming Covid-19 is a global conspiracy, has compounded the mistrust and been been shared by influential figures. Among those trying to combat the disinformation with facts and humour is the Facebook site  Les Vaxxeuses . “Vaccines are the biggest medical advance … don’t let lies make you doubt the benefits,” the website says. Over the weekend anti-vaccination proponents were dealt a blow when the far-right leader Marine Le Pen changed course and said she would agree to receive a Covid jab, having previously voiced her opposition. Ministers are confident France’s vaccine programme will catch up in the coming weeks, insisting it is “a marathon, not a sprint”. “Once access to the vaccine becomes a reality people will have the vaccine. They have had enough,” Vignaud says. Raude agrees the government’s “slow steps” strategy appears to be working. “The  government has been slow and careful  so as not to frighten people … when French people see the benefits, they will do it.”

What's the furthest from goal a player has seen red for a professional foul?:	“What is the furthest away from goal someone has been sent off for a professional foul?”  muses Robert Davies. Our thoughts immediately settled on Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s gloriously cynical  scything down of Newcastle’s Rob Lee  at Old Trafford in 1998 but by the time the Norwegian actually made contact with Lee’s shins, he was only around 30 yards from goal. How about  this shocking decision  from the 1991 League Cup quarter-finals then, when Southampton’s Jimmy Case was sent for an early bath after hauling down Bryan Robson – hardly known for his blistering pace – a good 40 yards from goal with two covering defenders for company? At the beginning of the season referees had been instructed to tighten up punishment for fouls that denied a clear goalscoring opportunity and, on this evidence, they had a loose understanding of what that meant. Another example from September 2018, in which Aberdeen’s Michael Devlin was given his marching orders  for a foul around 45 yards from goal , suggested officials were still struggling many years later. Aberdeen fail to overturn Michael Devlin's red card against Kilmarnock. Your thoughts? ➡️  https://t.co/Bsp8HyvWfS   pic.twitter.com/EeyiaKm9Gs Simon Kaplan has a potential winner. “I’d suggest Gary Cahill playing for Bolton against Tottenham in December 2011,” he writes. “He got a red card (rescinded on appeal) for denying Scott Parker a ‘clear goalscoring opportunity’ by taking him out about five yards inside the Bolton half.” Owen Coyle measured it for us in his post-match rant: If you understand the terminology it has to be a clear goalscoring opportunity. Now, Scott Parker is a fantastic player but he took a touch with his left foot, went out to the wing, 50 yards from goal. We had Zat Knight in the middle and other defenders coming back. However, if  this video evidence  is anything to go by, we reckon Mikel Arteta can match those 50 yards after bundling over Marouane Chamakh at Crystal Palace in 2013. “He was far from goal, it was an accidental foul, he was not the last man,” protested Arsène Wenger. Arsenal didn’t appeal, so the red card stood. “Has any club scored as many goals in the Champions League group stages as Manchester United this year (15) and not qualified for the knockouts? ” wonders Tim Leehan. While we’ve been polishing off the last few Quality Street, Yorben Geerinckx has done the hard yards for us. “If I’m correct, this only happened twice,” he suggests. “The first time was in 2012-13 when Chelsea scored 16 and amassed 10 points, as many as Shakhtar Donetsk. The Ukrainian side went through because they scored more away goals in the games between the two, with later-to-be-Chelsea player Willian scoring twice at Stamford Bridge in a 3-2 loss, which would prove sufficient to progress after a 2-1 home win. Juventus topped that group and Chelsea would go on to win the Europa League. “The second time was last season. RB Salzburg introduced Erling Braut Haaland to the world and also scored 16. Liverpool won that group and Salzburg finished five points behind runners-up Napoli, progressing to the Europa League, where they were eliminated by Eintracht Frankfurt in last 32.” Paul Moran unearthed the same examples and came up with some new ones. “In poring over 27 years of Champions League group stages, I found that Group D of the 2005-06 competition surprisingly only featured 12 goals across the 12 games. Two 2-1 results were the highest-scoring fixtures and, incredibly, Lille managed to secure six points and third place (transferring to the Uefa Cup) despite only scoring once – they were helped by an impressive defence which conceded just two goals.” Perhaps Jorge Valdano was right about  that particular era of European football . Anyway, back to Paul. “Has any other group stage in a competition (or even a whole competition) featured a goals-per-game figure of less than one? Or has any team in a group stage/competition had a lower figure of goals-per-game (scored + conceded) than Lille’s 0.5?” Send your answers to  knowledge@theguardian.com  or tweet  @TheKnowledge_GU . “Portsmouth won 2-0 at Hull with only one shot on target and it didn’t come from Pompey (there were two own goals),”  writes Eddy Reynolds. “ Is this a record?” Nope. Burnley have gone one (none? – Knowledge Ed) better. “I watched Fulham lose 2-1 at Burnley in January 2019,” writes Jon Gundry. “That Fulham lost was not a surprise. We haven’t won at Turf Moor since 1951. Even in a desperately poor season ending in relegation from the Premier League, it was a surprise to lose when Burnley  did not have a shot on target . Fulham conceded two own goals by Joe Bryan and Denis Odoi. André Schürrle scored a cracker at the right end.” Worthy of note is this from Mike Dunford, who recalls Southampton’s  6-0 smash-and-grab win at Wolves  in 2007. “Memory serves that we had five shots on target. Mick McCarthy’s team were so unfortunate – and I speak as a Saints fan who saw it – that the home supporters  applauded  their team off. Has that ever happened in a bigger home defeat? And has anyone ever won by more goals in which every shot on target went in?” Patrick Brennan has one, at least. “ Luton beat Blackburn 3-2  on the last day of the 2019-20 season with one shot on target (a penalty) and two own goals,” he tweets. “If they hadn’t won they’d have gone down.” “Arsenal have been beaten home and away by Manchester United and Chelsea,”  noted Paul Brazier in March 2010.  “Has any side become champions of England despite losing all four games against the teams in second and third place?” In short, no. There have been a few examples of the champions losing three and drawing one, the most recent being Aston Villa in the 1980-81 season. They drew 1-1 at home to third-placed Arsenal, losing 2-0 at Highbury (the day they clinched the title), and lost both fixtures to second-placed Ipswich: 2-1 at Villa Park in mid-April and 1-0 at Portman Road. “Wikipedia reliably informs me there are five clubs that Sam Allardyce has played for and managed: Limerick, Preston, Bolton, Sunderland and West Brom. Can any manager beat that?” asks David Skinner. Has any other manager recovered from a huge loss (yes the 9-0!) and some as well as Hasenhuttl has? Or simply not been sacked. It’s an astonishing turnaround. @blzzrd   @OptaJoe   @guardian_sport  might know #SaintsFC   #Hasenhuttl “In the Boxing Day match between Dover Athletic and Dagenham & Redbridge, the referee was James Durkin, son of former top-flight referee Paul, who officiated Dover Athletic v Cheltenham Town in the 1998 FA Trophy semi-final,” reports Alex Crane. “Are there any other instances of a father and son refereeing at the same ground at National League level or higher?” @TheKnowledge_GU  Do you know the long and short of this question?  https://t.co/wLRqy70wXf “After an FA Cup tie on 1 February 1913, Burnley, then riding high in the Second Division, beat Midland League Gainsborough Trinity 4-1,” begins John Spooner. Trinity led until the last half hour, largely due to the efforts of goalkeeper Ronnie Sewell and his full-backs Cliff Jones and Sam Gunton. At full-time, Burnley made a bid to buy the trio  en bloc . The deal was sealed by 6.20pm that evening. Has a similar instance of players being signed by the opposition at the final whistle happened since?” Or similar bulk buys? @TheKnowledge_GU  Excluding one off huge wins, what's the highest goals-per-game ratio in a cup run?

FA Cup third round: 10 talking points from the weekend's action:	Willian was a stalwart for Chelsea, even if he was often perceived as a notch below their brightest stars. Last summer he was given the chance to become a leading light for Arsenal but he has flopped, giving them another expensive problem. Against Newcastle he had an opportunity to show that their recent upturn, which coincided with his absence through illness, could be sustained in his presence but instead he produced more of the same. This season was a chance for Willian to put his mark on games but he has cast scant influence while the likes of Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe point the way forwards. Ordinarily there would be little problem in keeping a 32-year-old international around as experienced filler but Willian arrived on a hefty wage that Arsenal are committed to paying until mid-2023. They cannot afford him to be a luxury item and, if he does not rediscover some form, he will follow Mesut Özil on the list of costly conundrums that need solving.  Nick Ames Match report:  Arsenal 2-0 Newcastle (aet) Crawley haven’t finished higher than 14th since being relegated to League Two in 2015 and have often been tipped to fall back into the non-league game from which they won promotion in 2011, but John Yems has assembled a slick and potent side this season who are unbeaten since late November and, in sixth, look a decent bet to go up. Some might fear that an extended Cup run will derail a stretched squad’s league ambitions but the manner of their victory over Leeds should only fuel them. This was no smash and grab giantkilling – Crawley dominated midfield against a team known for getting on the front foot wherever possible, enabling their attackers to expose the flaws in Marcelo Bielsa’s notoriously flaky defence, with Ashley Nadesan a perennial threat. That they managed to take control of the tie with their highly rated top scorer, Max Watters, sitting on the bench until the 72nd minute suggests they have what it takes to mix a Cup run with a promotion push.  Tom Davies Match report:  Crawley 3-0 Leeds With no fans in attendance and Derby reduced to sending their youth team to Chorley for Saturday’s tie in Lancashire, it was easy to forget that there are still overwhelming positives from an FA Cup run, even in these uncertain times. The National League North side, who are in the fourth round for the first time in their history following the  2-0 victory against the Covid-depleted Rams , estimate they could now make as much as £500,000 from a run which has now seen them knock four EFL sides out of the Cup. Their manager, Jamie Vermiglio, revealed before the Derby tie that getting to round three had, in no uncertain terms, saved the club. With more revenue set to follow in the weeks ahead, Chorley can plan for happier times. They are the first sixth-tier team to get this far since Havant and Waterlooville in 2008, only  to be beaten 5-2 at Anfield by Liverpool . Boyhood Reds fan Vermiglio admits that is his dream tie next.  Aaron Bower Match report:  Chorley 2-0 Derby Donny van de Beek started in this edgy win and was again accomplished, yet in the Premier League the Dutchman is more akin to the eternal substitute, being named in the XI by Ole Gunnar Solskjær only twice in his 10 appearances in the competition. If this makes judging the midfielder’s true worth particularly tricky it is evident that when he does feature, Van de Beek adds a quick, one-touch dimension to Manchester United that enhances their play and which the manager wants for his team. Van de Beek does not possess Paul Pogba’s X-factor creativity, Scott McTominay’s muscularity, Fred’s all-round game, nor is he a firefighter like Nemanja Matic but this is the point. Pairing the 23-year-old withany of these others offers United a different way of going at opponents and illustrates the depth of options the manager has in this department. Whether Van de Beek starts either of the next two trips, to Burnley or Liverpool, remains to be seen though.  Jamie Jackson Match report:  Manchester United 1-0 Watford Whether Sheffield United’s first victory for six months does anything when it comes to reigniting their seemingly doomed fight for Premier League survival remains to be seen but Chris Wilder recognised they had to stop the rot. Otherwise, he said, there would be consequences. From the moment his players trudged down the terrace of the Thatchers End, where the Bristol Rovers supporters’ bar doubled up as the visitors’ dressing room, they knew they had everything to lose and the League One side everything to gain. Wilder, who named only eight substitutes owing to injuries and illness, named arguably his strongest available team and finally they have something to build on before facing Newcastle at Bramall Lane on Tuesday, when league duty resumes. “This division is ruthless, cut-throat and it really doesn’t give a monkey’s about anybody and punishes when you when you’re not at your best,” Wilder said.  Ben Fisher Match report:  Bristol Rovers 2-3 Sheffield United Wolves had failed to keep a clean sheet in the 10 matches since beating Crystal Palace on 30 October, but looked much more defensively sound in Friday’s  FA Cup  third-round win. Winning only twice in that spell while alternating between Nuno Espírito Santo’s stock 3-4-3 formation and a less risk-averse 4-2-3-1, Wolves have appeared less solid. Despite fielding a back four, including the more attacking left-back option Rayan Ait-Nouri, Wolves managed to retain a more compact shape and were undone down the channels less than during the past two months against an admittedly compact Palace. Expected goals suggested they were three times more penetrative than Palace, with matchwinner Adama Traoré leading the way, but it was the tighter defensive performance that boded just as well. Romain Saïss is playing with increasing conviction alongside Conor Coady and, just in front, the returning Leander Dendoncker and, especially, Rúben Neves provided a better screen.  Pete Lansley Match report:  Wolves 1-0 Crystal Palace This was due to be the day for Sergio Agüero. After six successive games on the bench Pep Guardiola had promised him a first start since October. Then the teamsheets were submitted and there was no sign of Manchester City’s greatest goalscorer. He was absent but not injured. He is self-isolating and is almost certain to miss Wednesday’s game with Brighton, perhaps even Sunday’s against Crystal Palace. And, given how Guardiola seems concerned the Argentinian’s battle-worn body will break down again, perhaps more training sessions and substitute appearances will be required before he is deemed ready to start. A frustrating 2020 – Agüero could bring up a year without a Premier League goal next week – may turn into a wasted final season in Manchester, a stop-start campaign where stops outnumber starts. With each setback it feels less likely City will see Agüero at his sharpest and most spectacular again.  Richard Jolly Match report:  Manchester City 3-0 Birmingham City Antonio Rüdiger seemed certain to leave Chelsea at the end of the previous transfer window. The German had completely fallen out of favour under Frank Lampard. However Rüdiger ended up staying at Stamford Bridge and has worked to put himself back in contention. Although he is not part of the regular back four, he is first in line behind Thiago Silva and Kurt Zouma in central defence, which has left another of Lampard’s defenders with a tough decision to make. Fikayo Tomori is one of five centre-backs in Chelsea’s squad and the England international, who turned down the chance to join West Ham on loan in October, will feel that he needs to move this month. The 23-year-old is fifth choice at the moment and, although Lampard made changes against Morecambe, Tomori was on the bench for the win over the League Two side. After coming on in the 80th minute, he needs a loan.  Jacob Steinberg Match report:  Chelsea 4-0 Morecambe Spurs and José Mourinho left with their reputation intact thanks to a quintessentially professional performance at Marine with Dele Alli at its heart. The midfielder has been out of favour for the majority of the Portuguese’s reign in north London and a cold night out at a non-league ground could be seen as a punishment for the England international. It was, however, a test for Alli, to show his quality against an eighth-tier side and prove he has the desire to succeed at Spurs. From the evidence of the opening 20 minutes, Mourinho has been justified in casting Alli aside for parts of the season. Things clicked soon after as he picked up the ball and drifted into the box before laying the opener on a plate for Carlos Vinícius. A clipped pass to Matt Doherty created the second goal and with two moments of class the game was over. Alli looked driven for the 65 minutes he was on the pitch and will be hoping his performance will justify more time on the pitch in the Premier League.  Will Unwin Match report:  Marine 0-5 Tottenham Two and a half years after signing for the club, Percy Tau finally made his Brighton debut – via three loan spells at different Belgian clubs – against Newport. The South Africa international was brought back from Anderlecht this month as Graham Potter looks to add to his firepower as he aims to take the Seagulls away from the relegation zone. The striker came on with 20 minutes of normal time to go. He looked lively and showed promising signs in his linkup play with Neal Maupay as Brighton attempted to break down their League Two opponents. Tau forced a save from Tom King and later smashed a fine chance to win the match over the bar. His scoring record in Belgium was underwhelming and the early signs of whether he has the composure to regularly convert the limited opportunities he will get in a Premier League relegation battle is yet to be seen.

Cities can lead a green revolution after Covid. In Barcelona, we're showing how:	T he pandemic will leave behind a very different world from that of a year ago. Thousands of people have died; entire industries have been brought to the brink; welfare states have been shaken. In the coming years, the major challenge facing all public leaders will be charting a path of recovery through the devastating human, social and economic marks that Covid-19 has left on our societies. But rather than redoubling on the fragile world of the pre-pandemic age, we should be taking advantage of this moment to build one that is more just, balanced and sustainable. Cities will play a key role in this process. Barcelona and its metropolitan area want to lead the response to one of the toughest situations that humanity has faced in modern times. Achieving this will mean tackling two interrelated challenges. We need to continue the fight against the climate crisis, spurred by the  European Green Deal . And we will need to boost the post-Covid economy through green technologies, sustainable industry and transport. Although these are global issues, change can begin in urban centres. Cities can play a pivotal role in transitioning energy use away from fossil fuels. They can adopt  non-polluting modes of transport  and build green public spaces that absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Barcelona has long been committed to these goals. Over the next decade, our  “superblock ” plan will transform the entire central grid of the city into a greener, pedestrian-friendly and almost car-free area. We’ll extend this model to the entirety of the  Eixample district , first designed in the late 19th century by the urban planner Ildefons Cerdà, who envisioned an integrated, modernist extension to Barcelona based around a grid system, providing new public spaces for mobility and recreation. The Covid-19 crisis has reminded us all of the importance of scientific advances. Progress in areas such as vaccines and testing are what will provide the exit route from this pandemic. Cities can play a role in nurturing science, technology and digital industries, something  Barcelona  has been doing for years, through public policies aimed at attracting talent and building new infrastructures. Our city is home to the MareNostrum 5 European supercomputer, for example. Built by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, this new type of computer can be used in areas such as human genome research, the design of new drugs and weather forecasting. And as mayor of Barcelona, I’m currently reviewing the proposal that the Spanish government has made to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts to make Barcelona the headquarters of this important institution, whose forecasting skills and environmental expertise are key to the fight against climate breakdown. Our aim is to become the major scientific and cultural capital of the Mediterranean, driving Europe’s transition towards a green and circular economy. And we can do so through the innovative, courageous and resourceful spirit that has long characterised our city, working to improve the quality of life of our neighbours, and ensuring that our post-pandemic society leaves nobody behind. Yet while cities can be leaders on these issues, it’s clear that they cannot – and should not – be doing this alone. Different levels of government should be working together with both public and private actors if we are going to be successful in the fight against the climate crisis and in building an equitable, green economic recovery. These are global challenges, and they will require international solutions. But cities are a good place to start. •  Ada Colau is the mayor of Barcelona
As Poles and Hungarians, we urge the EU to stand firm on the rule of law:	A s European leaders gather in Brussels this week municipal buildings and monuments in Warsaw and Budapest have been lit up in blue. The illuminations, organised by campaign groups and the mayors of these cities, are meant as a powerful reminder of the dark path ahead if the EU stands aside while the rule of law is extinguished in Poland and  Hungary . The lights are a call for solidarity with the millions of citizens of both countries who argue that EU funding should be conditional on their governments upholding these fundamental rights. The release of €1.8tn in EU funds for rebuilding after the pandemic and the EU’s 2021-2027 budget is at stake. So far agreement has  been derailed  by Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Poland’s Mateusz Morawiecki because of their unwillingness to accept that membership of the EU depends on  upholding democratic values . This, of course, is not a new fight for these two leaders. For years now, we in  Poland  and Hungary have had to contend with our national governments undermining the fundamental values: democracy and human rights that underpin membership of the EU. Hundreds of thousands of us have taken to the streets, year after year, to fight their attempts to control our country’s media, judiciary, and democratic political systems. The list of violations of rule of law, civil society, judicial independence, and press freedom in our countries is long. Famously, the Hungarian government has trampled on academic freedom by  making it impossible  for the Central European University in Budapest to operate – the first time a university has been forced into exile since the War. In Poland, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party took control of the formerly independent National Council of Judiciary – ensuring that appointment, promotion and disciplining of the nation’s judges was to be decided by party loyalists. As I write, PKN Orlen, Poland’s state-run oil company,  has just bought Polska Press , a private media outlet that reaches 11 million Poles every day. Critics are expressing concern, and they are right to do so, given the pattern of events in Orbán’s Hungary. Here, independent media outlets have fallen, one after another, into the hands of pro-government figures – to the extent that almost no independent, or critical government media, now exists in the country. It is not an exaggeration to say that democracy is under threat in Poland and Hungary. In a major  survey  of citizens, last year, two-thirds of Poles (64%) indicated that they thought the rule of law was being undermined in their country. While, in Hungary, 58% of respondents felt that their political system was “broken”. I still remember the celebrations in my home town when Hungary joined the  European Union  in 2004. To those that had grown up behind the iron curtain, it was a moment when we knew that we would be safe from tyranny and part of a collective with our European friends. Through our membership of the EU, we have been able to undergo reforms that have solidified and strengthened the rule of law, guaranteed freedoms, and let us live and prosper as Europeans. And this is a position that is reflected, in survey after survey, with a recent round of  polling  finding that 73% of Poles and 65% of Hungarians believe membership of the EU has been good for the prosperity of their country. At aHang in Hungary and Akcja Demokracja in Poland, we have been supporting hundreds of thousands of citizens in both countries who believe in a mechanism that links EU funding to the rule of law. We have received messages of support from people expressing such sentiments as: “being spirit and body in  Europe  was my dream of youth”; “Poland’s accession to the EU was a very special day for me”; and “the current actions of the Polish government are a crime against its citizens”. These are sentiments that are widely held and which are being ignored by Orbán and Morawiecki. EU leaders  face a choice. They can appease Orbán and Morawiecki and let down the citizens of Hungary and Poland who are concerned about basic freedoms. This would embolden the two leaders and show other nationalist leaders that the tactics of blackmail can be effective. It would fuel a further shift to authoritarianism, not just in Hungary and Poland, but across Europe, and cause unnecessary fracturing of the EU27. An alternative would be to face down these “paper tigers” and stand with the citizens of these two countries for the defence of our values, as Europeans. We, and hundreds of thousands of citizens from Hungary and Poland, urge them to stand firm against the bullying tactics of Orbán and Morawiecki, and to set an example of how Europe treats autocrats. There is no east and west divide among the populations of the EU27. We are as committed to democracy and rule of law, and have as much right as western Europeans to demand our leaders leave them intact. We need the support of the rest of the EU to defend the values we share. •  Máté Varga is the founder of aHang (theVoice), Hungary’s largest progressive campaign group, and the president of the Civil College Foundation
Messina to Maastricht: the modest European towns that marked the road to Brexit:	I oannina is no Mykonos. A city on the northern Greek mainland near the border with Albania, it is landlocked and rarely on any tourist trail. As far as guidebook mentions go, it’s silverwork, feta cheese and local spring water. But back in spring 1994 it burst on to front pages across  Europe , seizing the minds of politicians. Ioannina joined the ranks of little-known European cities to host a European summit and become a household name for a fortnight. From Messina to Maastricht, such places will fill history books of the future as they retrace the story of European integration – and Britain’s troubled joining and departure. In March 1994, Europe’s foreign ministers, meeting in Ioannina, were arguing about power and who really gets to wield it. The debate was all about the EU’s smaller countries “taking back control”. The result – the Ioannina compromise – was a seemingly arcane technical bargain about voting rights in an enlarged EU, but it paved the way for fewer national vetoes and deeper European integration. Ten years earlier, in June 1985, it was Schengen – not even a town or city, but a Luxembourg village – that was on everyone’s lips. With a population of fewer than 5,000, and previously known only for its wine-making, it is close to where the territories of Germany, France and Luxembourg meet. A number of European nations met there to sign the momentous Schengen agreement – a milestone in Europe’s integration, which abolished border controls over much of Europe. And though most people think it started in 1957 with the Treaty of Rome – rich with imperial symbolism, surely – the key breakthrough actually came a few years before, in the more obscure city of Messina, the third-largest on the island of Sicily. Messina kicked off the whole EEC project. However, the British famously didn’t go. Old Foreign Office hands reminisced that was it was “too outlandish and far away” to send a UK government representative. Forty years later and over 1,000 miles north, it was another “m” that unexpectedly took centre stage. In the student-filled but quiet medieval town of Maastricht, on the banks of the River Meuse in the Netherlands, European leaders took the huge twin strides of creating the euro and launching a European political union – creating the treaty that took the city’s name. Imagine how the UK tabloids would have coped if the meeting had been in Berlin. The journey of subsequent European treaties snaked across Europe in a winding path worthy of any student’s interrail ticket – from Amsterdam to Nice to Lisbon – each stop a step on the way to more European integration. But these places are synonymous not only with leaps forward in the European project, but also rising arguments over it, as Britain fell more and more deeply out of love with the EU. Dublin – one of Europe’s smaller capitals – witnessed one of Britain’s most momentous rows with European leaders. The acrimonious summit held there was Margaret Thatcher’s first, and was dominated by her demands for her money back. As Helmut Schmidt, the then German chancellor, quipped: she had hardly spent a penny and she wanted her pennies back. The row simmered through summit after summit until it was finally defused five years later at Fontainebleau. But perhaps the most poignant is another small French town with an impressive chateau, traditionally the summer residence of French presidents. Britain’s uncomfortable relationship with Europe is symbolised by the rebuff at Rambouillet. In December 1962, the then British prime minister, Harold Macmillan, was doggedly fighting to get Britain into the European club against resistance from the French leader, General De Gaulle. Meeting at Rambouillet’s chateau, Macmillan was bluntly let down by his French counterpart. Realising his plans to get Britain into the EEC were in ruins, Macmillan reportedly left the town in tears, leaving Britain to wait another 10 years. Security concerns and growing workloads mean that more and more meetings are held in Brussels. But the crisscrossing journey to obscure European backwaters will continue without the UK. The decisive meetings on Europe’s future won’t be hosted by Carlisle, Leicester or any other UK town – but they could be in Belgrade or Minsk. •  This article was amended on 5 January 2021. Schengen is located near to where Germany, France and Luxembourg meet, rather than Belgium, France and Luxembourg as a previous version said.

Unlike Trump, Europe's far-right leaders haven't been damaged by the pandemic:	B y now it is almost received wisdom that “populists” (often used as a euphemism for “the far right”) have ignored the threat of Covid-19, that populists have been the electoral victims of the pandemic, and that the pandemic has exposed the political incompetence of populists in government. Most of this speculation is based on one or two individual cases, most notably the US president, Donald Trump. But he is the exception rather than the rule. In a recent  comparative study  of far-right parties in the European Union, we found that none of those three assumptions holds up to scrutiny. In fact, there has been significant variety in far-right responses to the pandemic. In contrast to Trump, most European far-right parties were quick to point to the danger of the virus to the point of outright alarmism, although many started to walk that back after the number of cases had peaked, and some even started to spread misinformation. Matteo Salvini and his League party in Italy saw the virus as a major threat, but with time opinions on Covid started to fluctuate. The main reason was that the most affected regions in Italy were governed by the League. Consequently, the party went from Salvini’s  alarmist appeals  to close the borders and ban the Chinese new year, to claims that the virus was not that bad by the League governor of the  hardest-hit province, Lombardy . Many far-right parties in opposition initially criticised their governments for responding too slowly, but quickly became the loudest critics of the alleged “anti-democratic” and “unconstitutional” government policies when lockdowns were introduced. For instance, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) argued that freedom of speech was “the clearest victim of corona”, while the Austrian Freedom party (FPÖ) claimed that it had stopped “totalitarian” surveillance plans. By contrast, far-right parties in government implicated the opposition in spreading the virus or frustrating the national response. For instance, the Hungarian government targeted the mayor of Budapest for mismanaging the situation, while Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki argued that the opposition, “instead of taking care of peace and helping, threw sand in the modes”. The second misperception is that far-right parties have been the big losers of the pandemic – recently strengthened by the claim that Trump lost the election because of Covid-19. However, in our study of 31 far-right parties in EU member states, only half lost some support in the first, more acute, coronavirus wave, from mid-March to mid-June. Of the rest, five gained support, and 10 experienced no change in the polls. Moreover, the overall effect was marginal, within 1% on average. Far-right parties have started to lose a bit more during the continuing second wave, although the averages remain small and within the polls’ margin of error. Once again, government status seems to play a role. The far-right parties in control in Hungary and Poland mostly gained in the first wave but lost the most in the second wave. Far-right parties in governing coalitions were initially not affected but have now seen some small losses. And far-right parties in opposition, the vast majority, experienced some small losses in the first wave that have largely disappeared in the second wave. So, did the   pandemic expose “the incompetence” of the far right in power? The European data provides little evidence for this. Countries with far-right governments adopted the strictest measures of all; and while those with far-right parties in coalition took less severe measures, it is hard to assess those parties’ roles. And in terms of cases and deaths per population, the numbers are mostly lower for countries with far-right parties in government or in coalition than for countries where the far right is in opposition. It should be noted that all the countries with far-right government participation are in central and eastern  Europe , the region least hit by Covid-19 in the first wave. Still, even here countries with far-right parties in government did slightly better than other countries in the region. In short, much of the public debate about the far right, populism and Covid-19 is wrong. Overall, the far right has not ignored Covid-19, has not been its electoral victim, and has not been exposed as incompetent by the pandemic. While the far right has generally framed Covid-19 and the pandemic in line with its ideology (nativism, authoritarianism, and populism), its policy responses have differed, mainly based on whether they are in government or opposition. More than anything, these findings show that we should stop viewing the European far right through the prism of Trump. The US president is in many ways the exception rather than the rule in terms of far-right politics. And as Trump leaves the White House, far-right parties remain major players in Europe. •  Cas Mudde is Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia; Jakub Wondreys is a PhD student specialising in European politics at the University of Georgia
The violence at the Capitol was an attempted coup. Call it that:	O n Wednesday, a coup attempt was led by the president of the United States. A rightwing mob attempted the coup in the form of  a violent riot that stormed the Capitol building . They disrupted the proceedings that would have completed the recognition of the election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Those proceedings had been disrupted earlier by elected officials bringing forth bad-faith claims that the election was not legitimate and should instead produce a continuation of Trump’s presidency. This too was a coup attempt, an effort to violate the constitution and override the will of the voters in this election. Inside and outside were two faces of the same thing, and both were fomented by the leaders of the Republican party and by the US president. The mob outside would not exist without the politicians inside. Those insiders will make noises of horror and repudiation, but they own this. Had Mitch McConnell and other Republican leaders recognized the legitimate winner of the election in early November, had there been no challenge to a legitimate election from inside the government, there would have been no mob. Having failed to suppress enough votes to guarantee a Republican presidential victory, the Republican party and the Trump administration decided to try to suppress them retroactively. Trump invited the mob and whipped it up for months and set it off today, as surely as if he’d lit a bomb’s fuse. I call it a coup attempt because, though I assume it will not prevent the Biden presidency, it certainly intended to, and is part of a campaign to delegitimize and thereby weaken the incoming administration. It was a long time coming, building up for years with white rage, especially white male rage fuelled by everyone from Trump himself to the National Rifle Association, Fox News and the various rightwing pundits, the Republican party, the various faces of white supremacy, and far-right groups such as the Proud Boys. It is a rage against the fact that other people might be equal under the law, that women and people of color might also govern as power begins to be distributed more equally, the same rage that attempted to delegitimize a black president with birtherism and obstruction. It is a rage against equality. Democracy is a set of agreements to make decisions together and respect the outcome whether you like them or not. The kind of violence we saw on Capitol Hill is authoritarian, a way to try to force other people to submit to the will of the perpetrators. This violence comes from the white men who were long the only people with power in this country imagining themselves as marginalized and oppressed outsiders because others might also have power and a voice. We saw these kind of men last summer, when they invaded the Michigan capital while carrying semiautomatic rifles and saw them again when a handful of them were arrested for a plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. We saw them in racist shootings from the Texas border to a Pennsylvania synagogue. This coup attempt was built by the more and more uninhibited ideology of violence we have seen again and again, in the mass shootings that became a norm in 21st-century America, the fetishization of guns and gun rights that made the killing machines and the death they inflict far more common, so that death by gun recently overtook death by car as a leading American way to die. As I write, I hear a Republican leader on TV say “Remember we are the party of law and order,” and, of course, the riot going on in the Capitol is technically lawless, but “law and order” as a rightwing slogan means that they are the law and they impose their version of order. Authoritarianism is always an ideology of inequality: I make the rules, you follow them, I change them at will and punish those who don’t obey, or, if I feel like it, those who do because I can. Political scientist Frank Wilhoit once said: “Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition … There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.” They are demonstrating that nothing binds them and that they expect to have whatever they want. Entitlement is too demure a word for this. Authoritarianism is always an ideology of inequality: I make the rules, you follow them, I punish those who don’t obey What is at stake in America today is the outcome of an election. But it’s also the rule of law and the rights of voters. And in the end it’s also about the authority of facts and evidence and history and science, that no one has the right to override those things for personal gain. Trump’s position all along has been that he in particular has that right. Today it came to a head and became a crisis as a mob sabotaged a constitutionally mandated procedure for the peaceful transition of power. This was always going to happen because Trump’s power was always going to be finite in reach and duration under the law, and because he wants that power to be infinite, he was always at war with the law, and he always had a volunteer army willing to help him take it. Today they acted like an army, a hostile occupying force in the nation’s capital. This is what he wanted and this is what he orchestrated and this is what we got. Trump was the most prolific public liar America has ever seen, and his lies were an essential part of his authoritarianism, a refusal to be bound by facts, even the facts of what he said or did the day before. He demanded a parallel narrative in which he won the election and laid the groundwork long before to claim, if he lost, that it was illegitimate, as he did in 2016. In a recorded video on Wednesday, Trump said to the crowd “We love you” as he told them to go home but also reasserted that the election was stolen, which is why they’re there in the first place. Ivanka Trump apparently deleted a tweet in which she called them “American patriots”. The Trumps and their loyalists in office will disavow the worst of what happened and pretend to be surprised by it and continue feeding it. Conversation about what’s been happening over the past several months has often bought into the false binary that either we have a successful coup, in which they steal the election, or we have a failed coup, but there is something insidious in-between: the delegitimization of the democratic process and the incoming administration. In this in-between state, Trump supporters continue to regard their leader and themselves as above the law and entitled to enforce it however they see fit, on the basis of whatever facts they most enjoy having. They are building a separate reality and appear to wish for a shadow government to beleaguer and undermine the legitimate one. Today, we’ve seen it in action.

Schwarzenegger rebukes Trump and compares Capitol riot to Kristallnacht:	Arnold Schwarzenegger issued  a stinging rebuke  of Donald Trump on Sunday, comparing the riot at the US Capitol which the president incited to Kristallnacht, the night  in November 1938  when Nazi thugs attacked Jewish Germans and their property, a harbinger of horrors to come. He also compared American democracy to a weapon he wielded onscreen in the loincloth of Conan the Barbarian nearly 40 years ago, saying: “Our democracy is like the steel of this sword. The more it is tempered, the stronger it becomes.” Trump supporters  broke into the Capitol on Wednesday  after the president told them to “fight like hell” in support of his attempt to overturn election defeat by Joe Biden. Five people died, including a Capitol police officer who was hit with a fire extinguisher and a rioter shot by law enforcement. Authorities have made  numerous arrests , among them one man charged with bringing firearms and explosives to Washington and another who allegedly threatened to kill the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Chants of “ Hang Mike Pence ” were heard and one rioter was seen carrying plastic “zip tie” handcuffs, suggesting plans to kidnap lawmakers. Trump, who will leave office on 20 January, now faces a second impeachment. As a  two-term governor of California  as well as the star of the Terminator franchise and other action classics, Schwarzenegger maintains a presence and a  voice  in Republican politics.  He has clashed with Trump before . On Sunday, in  a video posted to social media  and scored to rousing classical music, the 73-year-old said he “would like to say a few words to my fellow Americans and to our friends around the world about the events of recent days”. “I grew up in Austria and was very aware of Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass,” he said. “It was a night of rampage against the Jews carried out [by] the Nazi equivalent of the Proud Boys [a quasi-fascist group of Trump supporters].” “Wednesday was the Day of Broken Glass right here in the United States. The broken glass was in the windows of the United States Capitol. But the mob did not just shatter the windows of the Capitol. It has shattered the ideals we took for granted. They did not just break down the doors of the building that housed American democracy. They trampled the very principles on which our country was founded.” On Sunday it was reported that another officer had died, though it was not immediately clear if the death was related to the Capitol riot. Schwarzenegger described a traumatic childhood in post-war Austria, the son of a police officer who joined the Nazi party. “I have seen firsthand how things can spin out of control,” Schwarzenegger said. “I know there is a fear in this country and all over the world that something like this could happen right here. I do not believe it is. “But I do believe that we must be aware of the dire consequences of selfishness and cynicism. President Trump sought to overturn the results of an election. And a fair election. He sought a coup by misleading people with lies. My father and our neighbours were misled also with lies. I know where such lies lead. “President Trump is a failed leader. He will go down in history as the worst president ever. The good thing is he soon will be as irrelevant as an old tweet.” Schwarzenegger appealed to Americans’ patriotism and commended lawmakers who regathered after the assault on the Capitol to confirm Biden’s victory, despite objections from 147 Republican representatives and senators. He then picked up a sword which he said he wielded as Conan the Barbarian in  a pair of early 80s fantasy epics . “Here’s the thing about swords,” Schwarzenegger said. “The more you temper a sword, the stronger it becomes. The more you pound it with a hammer and then heat it in the fire, and then thrust it into the cold water and then pound it again … the more often you do that, the stronger it becomes. “I’m not telling you this because you become an expert swordmaker. But our democracy is like the steel of this sword. The more it is tempered, the stronger it becomes.” Wishing Biden well, Schwarzenegger said: “Those who think they can overturn the United States constitution, know this. You will never win.” Banned by Twitter, with no official duties for the day and with the White House pool reporter sent home before noon, Trump did not immediately respond.
Italian medics may be permitted to ration life-saving care under new pandemic plan:	The Italian health ministry has been criticised after a draft of the country’s new pandemic plan revealed medics would be permitted to choose which patients receive life-saving care. This is the first time Italy has updated its  pandemic plan since 2006 . The absence of an adequate plan is thought to have contributed to Italy’s coronavirus death toll of more than 79,000. The draft copy of the pandemic plan for 2021-23, seen by the Guardian, stipulates that while health workers are obliged to provide the best and most appropriate care to patients, there are circumstances that may make it necessary to prioritise who to try to save. Page 25 of the plan reads: “The imbalance between needs and available resources may make it necessary to adopt criteria for triage in access to therapies,” and therefore “scarce resources could be allocated in order to provide necessary preferential treatment to those patients who are most likely to benefit”. Doctors in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the coronavirus, were forced to prioritise younger patients due to a severe lack of resources at the beginning of the pandemic. Critics of the draft plan argue that  Italy  needs to be better prepared so that medics do not need to resort to triage. Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister who leads Italia Viva, a small party in the ruling coalition, wrote on Twitter: “If resources are scarce, you must choose who to care for. I have a simpler idea. If resources are scarce, we can take from the ESM [European stability mechanism]. What’s not to understand?” For months, the government has been at loggerheads over the ESM, the EU’s bailout fund, which could be used to help the country’s health system manage the coronavirus pandemic but which one of the coalition partners, the Five Star Movement, has objected to on the grounds that it infringes on Italy’s national sovereignty. Ettore Rosato, an Italia Viva MP, wrote on Facebook that the possible triage policy was “a huge disgrace for the country”. A health ministry source told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that the “informal draft” was shared with stakeholders and intended to “collect information and changes”. On page 19 of the plan, the ministry concedes that “the existing plan was edited in 2006 and has been valid until now”. The outdated plan is a key element in the preliminary investigations being carried out by prosecutors in Bergamo – the Lombardy province hardest hit during the first wave of the pandemic – into possible  criminal negligence by authorities . Prosecutors have already questioned the health minister, Roberto Speranza, and are seeking to question Giuseppe Ruocco, the health ministry’s director general of prevention, and his predecessor, Claudio D’Amario. It was revealed that Italy’s pandemic plan dated back to 2006  in a report  led by the World Health Organization (WHO) scientist Francesco Zambon into the country’s initial response to the coronavirus outbreak. It was published on the WHO website on 13 May but taken down the following day. Its removal  allegedly came at the request of Ranieri Guerra , the WHO’s assistant director general for strategic initiatives. Guerra was the director general for preventive health at the Italian health ministry between 2014 and late 2017, and was therefore responsible for updating the pandemic plan in accordance with new guidelines laid out by the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
Germany and Netherlands likely to extend Covid lockdowns:	Germany ’s tough anti-Covid measures are likely to last a further eight to 10 weeks, Angela Merkel has warned, while the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, is set to extend the  Netherlands ’ national lockdown into next month. As  Europe  struggles to stem the number of cases and deaths and concerns mount about the new, more contagious UK variant, the German chancellor said infections could rise 10-fold by Easter if the country did not succeed in containing the virus’s spread. Germany ’s lockdown, under which schools and non-essential shops and services have closed, was due to last until 31 January, but Merkel reportedly told a working group of her Christian Democratic Union: “We still need eight to 10 weeks of hard measures.” The country has been recording record daily case numbers and deaths in the 900-1,000 range but the figures remain skewed due to under-reporting over the Christmas holiday and a true picture is not expected to be available until 17 January. With new variants believed to be in  Germany , including the B117 variant from the UK and N501Y from South Africa, the health minister, Jens Spahn, has ordered labs to test every 10th sample for variants compared with every 900th sample previously. The  Dutch  government, meanwhile, is expected on Tuesday to extend the country’s lockdown by three weeks, with experts warning the country has no alternative since the number of positive tests, while declining, is not falling fast enough. The epidemiologist Amrish Baidjoe told the public broadcaster NOS that if the government relaxed the rules “and the British variant takes hold in the  Netherlands , then the figures can rise rapidly and we will end up with a situation like in Britain”. Dutch schools and non-essential shops were shut in mid-December after bars and restaurants closed two months earlier. Ministers have debated and rejected imposing a curfew, local media said, but the government is considering allowing primary schools in the Netherlands to reopen from 25 January. After a rise in the number of infections in the past few days, neighbouring  Belgium  may also face a sustained increase over the coming weeks as more people undergo tests after returning from holiday, health ministry spokesman Yves Van Laethem said. “The situation remains fragile,” Van Laethem said, adding that the country had last year recorded its highest annual mortality rate since the Spanish flu and the end of the first world war in 1918. The  EU , meanwhile, will have all the vaccine doses it needs from April when larger deliveries are made to the 27 member states, the bloc’s chief negotiator with the suppliers said in response to criticism. In evidence to the European parliament’s environment committee, Sandra Gallina ,  the   director general for health and food safety in the European commission, said the bloc had purchased as much vaccine as had been possible. “The contracts we have agreed include schedules that will be much richer starting from April onwards – quarter two is going to be the quarter with the many doses,” she said. “The first quarter doses … are of course not as abundant as many would like.” The commission has faced criticism for not buying enough vaccines. While it has secured up to 2.3bn doses from the most promising vaccine candidates, only two – BionTech/Pfizer and Moderna – have as yet received European regulatory approval. “I may say to you that we went really very far with the quantities and we bought all that could be bought,” Gallina said. “I am not sure why this debate is there, because the numbers are there, production is ramping up.” In a reminder of the serious economic consequences of the virus crisis, the  Greek  prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, called for the creation of an EU-wide vaccination certificate to help restore cross-border travel devastated by the pandemic. Greece , which relies on tourism for a fifth of its economic output and is keen to revive travel before the summer season, has already created its own standardised certificate to prove an individual has been vaccinated. But in a letter to the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, Mitsotakis proposed extending the scheme to all 27 countries in the EU. The certificate could be used when embarking on all forms of transport, he said. “While we are not going to make vaccination compulsory or a prerequisite for travel, persons who have been vaccinated should be free to travel,” he said. “It is urgent to adopt a common understanding on a vaccination certificate.” As  Portugal ’s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, tested negative for the virus after a positive test led to him cancelling all public engagements, it emerged that the tourism-dependent Algarve region had suffered its worst tourism year on record. Business made €800m (£704m) less in 2020 than the year before – a 65% drop – as the pandemic kept visitors away from the region’s beaches and golf courses. The Algarve hotel association AHETA said hotel stays fell 75% and occupancy was just 28%, compared with 63% in 2019.
Beach maximalism: a frenzy for cabanas and carts is taking over Australian shores:	A  friend and I took my blue and white-striped umbrella to Noosa beach the other day. I was a bit dismayed. From the path above the beach we surveyed the scene. Perhaps, I thought, we had fallen through the earth on to an Italian  spiaggia  – one of those private beaches where you can rent a sunbed or  cabina  and lie alongside rows of the idle rich, inert in large sunglasses. For half a kilometre or so, from Noosa headland to the breakwater, candy-striped cabanas were jammed, a higgledy-piggledy tent city for refugees fleeing the horrors of 2020. We picked our way through the chaos and found a small campsite near the rising tideline. But we didn’t fit in. For a start, I am lardishly pale and get freckles in the shade and my one-piece swimsuit is from a discount chain store. My umbrella was also out of place. Aside from its jaunty stripes, there’s not much to recommend it. In terms of technology, it’s backwards, of an era when my bare legs stuck to the vinyl back seat of Dad’s Valiant when we went to the beach and the Big Pineapple was the hottest ticket in town. As I knelt in the sand – sweating and breaking fingernails digging a hole deep enough in which to secure my unfashionable umbrella’s pole, then struggled against the wind to open its canopy – I felt the eyes of Costa del Noosa upon me. To our left, a thin, tanned woman shook out a towel emblazoned with the words “Pls Instagram this” and then retreated to the shade of her pineapple-patterned blue cabana. She stretched out on a lilo and picked up her book,  The President is Missing . Certainly, he was. Not so far from her, a man lay on a beanbag lounge and rested a beer on his belly. Beside him was a beach cart, that new essential for taking your whole house to the seashore – babies, toddlers, coolers, booze, food, towels, toys. (Seasonal style note: Wahu Surfer Dudes such as Sunny Coast Sammy or Bells Beach Bethany – figurines attached to miniature surfboards that kids toss into the whitewash – are 2021’s bucket and spade.) Behind us, blokes sitting in the sun outside their cabana were discussing the relative merits of local restaurants’ cocktails. “Would you say seven or eight out of 10?” asked one. “Mate, definitely an eight,” was the reply. Under her breath, my friend, a fan of chivalry, muttered that they could at least have offered to help us raise our recalcitrant umbrella. The cabana frenzy is pushing aside little old umbrella users like me and taking over prime beach real estate from Portsea to Bondi. “Don’t start me on them,” my friend Karen says of the structures, which have as much potential as an overbearing Sydney harbourside mansion to foment neighbourhood disputes over lost views. “You can’t see the waves.” The biggest cabana made by CoolCabana, which was sketched into being by an architect sunbathing at nearby Little Cove beach and is one of the more popular brands, is 5.76 metres squared. Another friend Kim, an unflinching umbrella aficionado, has observed a range of inconsiderate, entitled behaviours accompanying this new beach imperialism. “People are more prepared to put their own desire for comfort ahead of consideration of other beachgoers,” she says. Kim has seen someone erect their cabana on top of a temporarily absent swimmer’s beach towel and boogie board. She’s seen three deserted cabanas erected next to each other with mats running between them and empty sun lounges. Their residents were sunbathing out the front of their dwellings. Conversely, when the sun sinks in the afternoon, the shade often falls beyond the cabana and so people move outside into it, doubling their footprint. But for every ill-mannered beach builder, there is another who is courteous and simply appreciates a cabana’s practical benefits. “We were sick and tired of having to hold on to the umbrellas and being speared by other people who didn’t know how to put an umbrella in,” Tewantin resident Katrina tells me when I stumble into the cabana she is sharing with her family. I’m hoping she didn’t see me trying to secure my umbrella in the sand. Katrina notes how easy a cabana is to set up and points out the pockets in its corner struts for things like keys and sunglasses. She has a CoolCabana and matching CoolCabana loungers. Her fold-up Buddy Wagon is parked beside the cabana. “My little one gets in there when we’re coming to the beach,” she says. When she visits the farmers’ market, it’s a blessing for her bad back. My friend Kim sounds dubious when I ask her about the wagons, which variously come with accessories such as umbrellas, lids, awnings and portable coolers that hang off the sides. Hmm, she says, yes, she can see that if you have a distance to walk with small children they might be a good idea. But she wonders about the people she sees pulling them through Noosa national park. “Should you be visiting the national park with half a house, with everything but the kitchen sink?” she muses. “Trolleys seem to enable excess.”
Negative Covid test required to enter England from Friday:	International travellers will need to present a negative Covid-19 test to enter England from 4am on Friday. The government confirmed the start date on Tuesday morning after  announcing the plans last week . Passengers will be required to take a test in the 72 hours before departure by plane, train or ferry, and provide evidence of a negative result or be refused permission to board. The move comes  in response to the worsening incidence  of transmission around the world and particularly the emergence of new coronavirus variants, ministers said. Arrivals will still need to isolate for 10 days in the UK, or opt into the test-to-release programme, which potentially allows people to leave quarantine from the fifth day with a fresh negative test. The transport minister Robert Courts said: “Both globally and domestically we are seeing significant increases in levels of coronavirus, including the emergence of worrying new strains. “It is therefore imperative that we ensure we are doing all we can to protect travel, reduce the risk of imported infections, including from new variants, and protect our NHS while national lockdown and vaccinations take effect.” The test standards are yet to be set out but will be mainly PCR tests and limited lateral flow tests. Courts said the UK government website would provide information on the kind of tests and documentation needed. The rules will also apply to British nationals, who would need to stay abroad and follow local rules on self-isolation if testing positive. The onus will be on airlines or other transport operators to check for a negative test and deny boarding without documentation, or face being fined. Passengers found at the border to be non-compliant will also be fined at least £500. Children under the age of 11 will be exempt, as will hauliers and transport operators’ crew. The measures are likely to be in place until the end of the lockdown, but will be reviewed before that, Courts said. Pre-departure testing will apply to Scotland and Wales equally but the start date has not been confirmed by the devolved governments. Airlines said they accepted the necessity for pre-departure testing but urged ministers to ensure it was lifted as soon as possible. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, said: “This is a national health emergency and ministers need to act to keep the country safe. It is true that much of the sector has been lobbying for pre-departure testing – but this was always predicated on the government removing or reducing the quarantine period at the same time. Now we have both.” He said the policy must be a “time-limited, emergency measure only”, adding: “We cannot afford for this to be baked in over the whole summer.”
Modern life is rubbish! The people whose homes are portals to the past:	W ill future generations look at the interior design of the early 21st century in appreciation? Possibly not. We do not appear to have crafted many design classics, unless slab-like corner sofas in mud-grey velvet are Eames chairs in the making. Our feature walls are gaudy;  our furniture cheaply made . Scarcely anything seems to be built to last, which is just as well, as the next Instagram-led interior design trend will be along soon enough. But there are those who retreat from modern trends into the interiors of the past, drawn by the allure of original designs. We speak to five people whose homes are portals into the past. Whiteside has assiduously converted his suburban semi into a prewar home. Photographs: Richard Saker My mum says that I was always into the 30s, ever since she can remember. I’d go around to my aunt and uncle’s house and play old dance band records. At weekends, I’d rummage in Patrick’s Saleroom, a sort of junk shop that’s still around today. I’d go there every weekend from the age of seven or eight and buy all sorts of weird things: gramophones, gas mantles, electric toasters, Bakelite hairdryers. I have an obsession with 30s vacuums. They’re the best! They really get all the crap out of the carpet. I shut the door and I'm in 1936 The music, the fashion and the style were magical. Even the food was great – everything was homegrown back then. I would go back in time now if I could, although I’d take my family with me. It probably wouldn’t live up to my expectations unless I was rich and able to do fun things such as go to the Savoy theatre and go out dancing. I grew up over the road from the house I live in. It used to belong to an old lady. She was well over 100 when I was a child. She was a real character: a former schoolteacher, very strict. Us kids used to call it the witch’s house, because if a ball hit her window you’d see an eye poke out from behind her venetian blinds. She’d come outside with a carving knife and cut the ball open. But she was a lovely lady, really. It must have been annoying for her, all these kids knocking balls into her windows. After she died, the house lay unused for nine years, until I bought it. I found her old ration book and letters from her sweetheart, who died in the first world war, under the floorboards. The letters were quite upsetting to read, knowing how he died young. Most of my furniture comes from Patrick’s Saleroom, unless it’s something rare and hard to find, in which case I use eBay. Everything is vintage, apart from my Alexa – but that’s hidden in an old speaker. I have a laptop for work and watching Netflix. But that’s it. I restored a 1951 Bush television, so I can watch old movies on it. I know it’s not from the 30s, but TVs weren’t popular back then. There’s a lot I don’t like about modern life. I find society quite greedy. Everyone’s a bit more selfish. If I live by any 30s values in my life, I suppose it’s trying to have good manners: be polite, and nice to folk, and help them as much as you can. When I come home from work, I like to shut the door and pretend I’m back in 1936. Not to the extent it’s freaky, though. I do go to work and see my friends and have a normal life. But my house is my little time capsule. The 30s stay here; when I leave the house, I’m back in the real world. I forget I have a 30s house. If I don’t warn people before they come over for the first time, they walk in, stop speaking, then ask me if it’s my grandparents’ house. I had a postman come to the house once and ask me if my mum and dad were in. I get it. It looks like an old lady’s house. Kelty  at home in South Uist. Photographs courtesy of Julie Kelty Everything in my house is 40s-style – or if it isn’t, it’s hidden away. I have three children, so there’s no way in the world I could get away without having modern things such as a TV and a washing machine. But the washing machine is covered with a curtain and the toaster is in a cupboard under the worktop. I have a real 40s toaster on the counter: I daren’t turn it on, even though it does have a plug fitted. My kids are always complaining about the toaster. They go: “Mum, why is the toaster in the cupboard?” I say: “Because that’s the way I like it!” But they don’t mind, really, because they know it makes me happy. I love the simplicity of the era I’m most proud of my living room. It’s so relaxing. I love the rocking chair and the old clock on the mantelpiece. If you don’t look at the TV, you can imagine you are in a 40s lounge. I love to sit there and read old magazines from the 40s. Sometimes, they have people’s addresses on the label. I think about them: what were they like? What lives did they lead? I get all my furniture on the island.  There’s a brilliant place called ReStore  that restores old furniture that people have donated: almost everything in my house is from there. There are two charity shops on the island that are also really good – I can always pick up beautiful things there and they aren’t expensive. The charity shops on the mainland know about vintage now; they put up the price. I dress in 40s clothes, too. I love the style – it’s very feminine. The ladies always got dressed up to go out back then. They took care, you know? No leggings and long T-shirts! I always wear a skirt, no matter what I’m doing. You have to wear thick tights in winter, though. I love the simplicity of the era. It’s not over the top, like it is now. There’s too much  stuff  now. It’s all about what car you have, or what clothes you wear. Even modern cars are stressful. There’s so much that can go wrong with them. Back then, things were simple and modest. It felt like everyone was in it together. People were different – they did things for each other. I love that sense of neighbourliness and community. If I had the chance to go back to the 40s, I’d love to go. Not to stay there – I imagine it was pretty terrifying to live through the war. But maybe after the war, when it was all over, to visit a world without cars and people everywhere. That’s one of the reasons my husband and I moved to Uist – to get away from technology and crowds and to live a simpler life. There are plenty of places on the island where you can look around and it’s exactly as it would have been in the 40s. Although, sadly, technology has followed us to the island – we got 4G last year. I’m constantly looking at my phone now. Adverts pop up and I think: “Ooh, I’d love to buy that.” I wish I wasn’t looking at my phone all the time. Preston at home in Bolton. Photographs courtesy of Emma Preston I’d say my style is mid-century American ranch style, with a tiki influence. I’ve always loved vintage style, ever since I was a teenager. In the 80s, I was into the mod scene. I remember walking into a friend’s house when I was about 19 and everything was styled like the 50s: there was a cocktail bar and 50s magazines. I thought it was so stylish. After that, I never looked back: I’ve decorated all of my houses in a vintage way. I feel wowed by it – every day When I started collecting in the 80s, you could pick up stuff in charity shops and flea markets for next to nothing. I still have a 50s pale-green and pink bedroom suite I got at a Manchester flea market in the early 90s. Nowadays, I get most of my things through specialist dealers, although you can also get good pieces from eBay and Etsy if you look hard enough. I’d love some Heywood-Wakefield or Paul Frankl rattan furniture and I’m desperate for an Alfred Meakin cactus teapot – I have almost the full set, but I’m missing the teapot. I have two cocktail bars. They are pretty special. One is a mid-century bar with a glitter vinyl front. My tiki bamboo bar I got from a friend who was selling it. I’ve owned several bamboo bars over the years. At one point, I had about four bars in my house at the same time. I had to get rid of them, though – you can’t keep them all. I do have modern bits in the house. My kitchen isn’t original. It’s styled on a Youngstown kitchen from the US; it would be difficult and expensive to ship one over, so I created the look using chevron cupboard pulls and aluminium trim on a modern kitchen. I had really positive comments on  my Instagram account  from people in the US, which was nice. The only thing in my house that I really hate is the TV, because it doesn’t fit with the decor. We have a modern TV – my husband, Nigel, insisted. It is nice to watch old movies on a decent screen, though. William Morris said that you should have nothing in your house that you don’t know to be useful or believe to be beautiful. Everything in my house is beautiful to me, apart from my telly – which is useful! I don’t wish I lived in the 50s. I love vintage style, not vintage values. When I’m reading magazines from that period, some of the adverts are so archaic. It’s all about buying the woman in your life a vacuum cleaner for Christmas. But I couldn’t live in modern surroundings, either. This trend for grey at the moment – I can’t bear it. Everything is grey. People are even painting the exterior of their houses grey! I need colour in my life. I’ve felt so fortunate to have this beautiful home during Covid. I get so much pleasure from every item in my home. It’s so lovely to sit at my bar and have a mai tai while I put some lounge music on. I feel so grateful to live here, look at everything and feel wowed by it – which I still do, every day. Grant  at his bar in Dunblane. Photographs: Nick Grant I didn’t have a fantastic childhood. My mum died when I was six, of a brain tumour. TV was my escape. Every Saturday evening, I lost myself in classic American shows like The Dukes of Hazzard, The A Team, Knight Rider. Those 80s shows often visually referenced the 60s and Americana. There’s definitely a bit of nostalgia there. I love that culture of hot rodding and classic cars My interest in the 60s started with cars. I’ve always driven classic cars. I have a ’57 Chevy – it’s black with a red roof. I love that culture of hot rodding and classic cars. It’s linked together, my love of cars and interiors. Living in Scotland, you need a bit of colour, especially at this time of the year. I looked at Chevrolet paint charts from the 60s. The dining room is painted in a turquoise colour that came from those charts. The dining chairs are Panton and the side tables are Bauhaus. I wouldn’t want to live in the 60s. I’ve always believed that things tend to get better, although the last few years have stretched that for me. I guess I’m a traditional person in that I like to work hard and live quietly. But, beyond that, I don’t really relate to 60s values. My wife and I, we’re equals. I like to combine modern conveniences with 60s styling. I’ve incorporated automation into the house, so all our lighting themes come on automatically at different times of the day. We have sound systems in every room. I love gadgets. But I make sure they’re all invisible. I don’t want them to change the look of the house, just make it easier to live in. I love things with a history. We put in double doors that I got from a salvage yard between the dining room and the kitchen. They were from a cruise liner built in 1959. They add layers of history to the house. When you touch them, it feels like there’s a story behind them. Being able to keep things going and give them a new life, instead of throwing them in landfill, feels right to me. Bilson  at home in Manchester. Photographs courtesy of Estelle Bilson My dad was an antiques dealer and cabinet maker, so I grew up with mahogany furniture – lots of Edwardian pieces and William Morris. I used to go to auctions with my dad from the age of three or four. I’ve always hunted for stuff – when I was a student, I’d go around picking furniture out of skips. I’m such a Womble! Back then, people would toss out G Plan – no one wanted it. I refuse to pay £300 for something I can find for £20 Everyone says to me: why the 70s? And I say: why not ?  It’s the colour, the shapes, the style. There’s some nostalgia there, too, because I’m just about old enough to remember the 70s. My grandparents kept all their 70s furniture well into the 80s. Back then, people bought quality and kept it for a long time, whereas now it feels as if everyone decorates their home at lightning speed to keep up with the latest Instagram trend. People treat their houses like fast fashion, whereas, 30 or 40 years ago, people had a style and stuck with it for 50 years. I have a Decca TV from the 70s that I found on Facebook Marketplace, three miles down the road. It’s ridiculous. The same model is on display in the Science Museum. It does turn on, but unfortunately the analogue signal was switched off in 2012, so I’m sending it to someone who specialises in making old appliances work on new systems. He’s going to make it compatible with Netflix and digital TV. I’m really tight. Everything is from Facebook Marketplace, car boot sales or eBay. I could go to specialist dealers, but I refuse to pay £300 for something I can find for £20 if I magpie about and keep looking. Sometimes, I’ll spend years looking for a specific piece. If I told you my search terms, I’d have to kill you. What I will say is that, if you want bargains, search broad. Type “coffee table” or “lamp”. It will take hours, but you’ll find gold for cheap. We have modern mattresses – I draw the line on that. And we have a modern TV. Oh, and a Dyson. Old vacuum cleaners are awful. My prized possession is a Marcel Breuer long chair. My dad had one when I was a kid, but he had to sell it in the 80s because he was short on money. Mine came up on eBay and the starting bid was £500. I had only £500 in my bank account, so I sat there shaking, waiting for the auction to run down. Then, with three seconds to go, I bid and won it. I felt sick. I cried and then called my dad. I wear 70s clothes, but not all the time. I’m a mum and I can’t swan around in a Jean Varon maxidress if there’s a four-year-old trying to smear yoghurt on me. Do I have vintage values? Absolutely not. I don’t sit about waiting for my partner to come home. I think a lot of things about the 70s were really bad. Thatcherism was shit, especially if you lived up north. If you watch Love Thy Neighbour, it’s so racist. If I had a time machine, I wouldn’t go back to the 70s. Actually – that’s a lie. I’d go back, stockpile a load of furniture and bring it back. But that’s about it. What I like the most about the 70s is the mindset. The roots of sustainable living started in the 70s. The quality of build and design is that much better. Nothing looks like it will fall apart in the next 10 minutes. There’s years of use left in this furniture. I’m so glad to be able to save it from landfill. •  This article’s main image was changed on 12 January 2021 for editorial reasons.
‘Don’t let your defences down’: the rise of investment scams (and how to avoid them):	 Ellen Manning  Mon 4 Jan 2021  12.32 GMT   Last modified on Mon 4 Jan 2021  12.34 GMT   Financial fraud is nothing new, but the number of  scams soared  in 2020 with fraudsters taking advantage of financial uncertainty and coronavirus worries to swoop on vulnerable victims. According to data published by  Action Fraud  in November, there was a spike in scams between May and September. The types are myriad, from stereotypical “romance” scams, where people are befriended online then duped, to fake tax emails and impersonation scams. But one of the most common to plague consumers is investment scams, with Action Fraud reporting that between September 2019 and September 2020 it received more than  17,000 reports  of investment fraud, involving £657.4m in losses, up 28% on the previous 12 months. According to Peter Hazlewood, group financial crime risk director at Aviva, investment frauds are one of the biggest trends when it comes to scams at the moment. He says that around 95% of the frauds reported to Aviva since the first lockdown are in this category, and the company has identified 26 other investment companies impacted by this type of fraud. Too good to be true? The scam capitalises on people’s worries about low interest rates by offering too-good-to-be-true investments that appear to offer high returns, and which are designed to lure in savers looking for a safe place for their investments. The highly-complicated schemes, often accessed via online links on popular search engines, present people with appealing “products” with attractive rates of interest purporting to be from trusted names such as Aviva. Mimicking everything from the company’s website to the sales and compliance staff who call to take details, the scams are proving worryingly effective in extracting people’s savings from them, leaving them with nothing. They come at a time when financial worries are high on people’s list. According to research by Aviva last year, nearly a third (30%) of UK adults aged 45-54 are concerned that the financial strain caused by the coronavirus pandemic is  negatively impacting their mental health . Investment scams prey on people from a specific demographic, says Hazlewood, and play on those worries about financial security. Often aged between 55 and 80, they are people who are nearing the end of their career or are retired and have built up an investment portfolio. “They may or may not be investment savvy but are almost all in the vulnerable category from the point of view of their age group,” he says. Spot and report The threat is sinister and very real, but being forewarned is forearmed, and more tools than ever are at consumers’ disposal to help them spot such scams and, should they fall victim, report them quickly. Aviva has launched its own  fraud hub , which offers a range of information about all the latest scams including real-life examples, names of companies that have tried to contact potential victims, and the option to report a scam (whether you’re an Aviva customer or not). It also includes a whole range of tips to help people keep their money safe. One of the pointers explains how to recognise potentially fake sites. While many are convincing, some telltale signs include poor-quality images and text, missing contact details or links that purport to take you to another part of the website but actually take you to a blank page or nowhere at all. Another key sign is something being too good to be true – yet, Hazlewood says, this is often the very thing that reels people in. “Some of these returns are advertised as between 4-6% per annum, which is unheard of at the moment, but people think: ‘Well, that’s much better than I’m getting, and, oh, it’s Aviva so it must be safe.’” Aviva isn’t alone in offering resources to help spot scams. The Financial Conduct Authority’s  ScamSmart scheme  also offers information on potential scams and frauds, as well as what to do if you think you’ve fallen victim to one. On top of these resources, Aviva’s says it’s vital to do your own research. Rather than seeing an offer on a comparison site or hearing about it from someone else and jumping in feet first, it’s important to check the company’s official website and speak to them directly. You should also take a close look at the website’s disclaimers and terms and conditions, Aviva suggests. Another layer of security is to go through an independent financial adviser or broker, says Hazlewood. But the biggest weapon is scepticism. “These frauds are designed to bring your defences down,” he says. “They are designed to be credible, so the most important thing is don’t let your defences down. Be sceptical the whole way through. Look on our fraud hub, check out ScamSmart, and just be sceptical.” Scammed? Act quickly But what if, despite all that, you do become a victim of fraud? It doesn’t mean all is lost, says Hazlewood, pointing out that in some cases people’s money has been recovered. But it’s often about time. “Speed is of the essence. The most important thing is to tell us. It can happen to anybody, and it’s a natural human reaction to be embarrassed, but don’t be. Don’t sit on it, because then the money is gone. If there is any concern whatsoever, tell us.” Many financial institutions, Aviva included, have options to report suspected fraud, says Hazlewood, and even the tiniest piece of information could be the “missing piece of the puzzle” when it comes to catching the perpetrators of this kind of financial fraud. “We’re trying really hard to bring these criminals to justice and we’re all working together along with law enforcement. Criminals do not respect organisational boundaries – we have to work together, so it’s very important that people get intelligence to us and we will support them through the whole process.” Find out how to harness your money superpower with tips, tricks, and information on managing money in today’s ever-changing world.

Trump charged with impeachment count as FBI warns of armed protests:	Donald Trump is facing a historic second impeachment after Democrats in the House of Representatives formally charged him with one count of “incitement of insurrection” over  the Capitol Hill riot . Five  people died  in the attack last week, including a police officer, which Trump prompted when he told supporters to “fight like hell” in his attempt to overturn election defeat by Joe Biden. Emerging video footage  has revealed  just how close the mob came to a potentially deadly confrontation with members of Congress. On Monday, security officials scrambled to ensure that Biden’s inauguration next week would not be marred by further violence. The US Secret Service will begin carrying out its special security arrangements for the inauguration this Wednesday, almost a week earlier than originally planned, although on Monday afternoon the acting secretary of homeland security, Chad Wolf, abruptly resigned, just days after calling the Capitol invasion “sickening”. Earlier, ABC News  said  it had obtained an internal FBI bulletin which detailed plans for “armed protests” and calls for the “storming” of state, local and federal courthouses and buildings across the country if Trump was removed from power before then. On Capitol Hill, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said on Monday that she would move forward with impeaching Trump if Vice-President Mike Pence did not remove him from office under the 25th amendment to the US constitution. “The president’s threat to America is urgent, and so too will be our action,” she said in a statement. As expected, Republicans on Monday blocked an effort to approve, by unanimous consent, a non-binding resolution calling on Pence to intervene and strip Trump of his power. That forces a full vote on the measure on Tuesday. Democrats are confident the measure will pass. A clause in the 25th amendment, never before invoked, describes how members of the cabinet can agree to remove a president under extreme circumstances. Pence, a staunch loyalist until the climax of Trump’s effort to overturn the election, has signaled no intention of joining such a move. If Pence refused to act within 24 hours of the measure’s passage and Trump still had not resigned, Pelosi vowed to begin impeachment proceedings. The already dim prospect of the vice-president turning on his boss, to whom he has been unfailingly loyal for the past four years, was all but extinguished after a meeting between Trump and Pence on Monday night, the first since a mob of the president’s supporters put the lives of lawmakers at risk. According to a senior administration official, Trump and Pence agreed that “those who broke the law and stormed the Capitol last week do not represent the America first movement” and “pledged to continue the work on behalf of the country for the remainder of their term”. On Monday, lawmakers introduced an impeachment article charging Trump with “high crimes and misdemeanors by inciting violence against the government of the United States” and thus having violated his oath of office.  The House will debate the charge on Wednesday. The Democratic congressman David Cicilline of Rhode Island, one of the Democrats leading the effort, tweeted that   the party had sufficient votes  to pass it and impeach Trump a second time – a first in American history. But for him to be removed would require conviction in the Senate. The Senate is in recess until after the inauguration, and Democratic leaders have said they will not take up impeachment until after the Biden administration has had time to try to have nominees confirmed and to pass key legislation in its first 100 days. President-elect Joe Biden on Monday afternoon said: “I think President Trump should not be in office. Period.” A small number of Republicans in the Senate and House have joined Democrats’ effort to remove Trump. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee and a key figure in the first Trump impeachment,  tweeted:  “Every day Trump stays in office, he’s a threat to our democracy. Congress must act, and with urgency.” But conviction in the Senate would be a long shot, as it was last time the president was impeached. Some Republicans have indicated support this time but about a dozen more will be needed for success. Trump was charged with two articles of impeachment in December 2019 and  acquitted in February  2020.  If Trump were convicted after he had left office, the Senate could decide to punish him  by barring him  from seeking office again, as opponents fear is his plan in 2024. Since the attack on the US Capitol, the president has retreated from the public eye and been banned from Facebook and Twitter, condemned by former allies and vowed not to attend Biden’s inauguration on 20 January. His silence was filled by full-throated calls from Democrats for his ejection from office – and meek pushback from some Republicans  calling for national “unity”  after their attempt to overturn the November election produced  one of the most  egregious acts of violence on Capitol Hill in two centuries. There are now signs that diehard Trump loyalists are planning to march on the Capitol yet again, on inauguration day, in an event branded online as “A Million Militia March”. The FBI has arrested dozens of participants in last week’s rioting and continued to circulate wanted posters of suspects, potentially dampening participation in another rally. But with nine days to go to the inauguration, officials were planning to secure the area. The mayor of Washington, Muriel Bowser, asked the Department of Homeland Security to put new restrictions in place and urged people to avoid the city on 20 January. The Pentagon, FBI, Secret Service and other agencies were reportedly placed on alert and the national guard said it would increase troops in Washington to at least 10,000 by Saturday. The National Park Service temporarily closed the Washington Monument “in response to credible threats to visitors and park resources”. The inauguration will be attended by Barack and Michelle Obama, George and Laura Bush and Bill and Hillary Clinton. Biden, the incoming Vice-President, Kamala Harris, and their families will be joined by the former presidents and their families in a visit to Arlington national cemetery, ABC reported. Such plans were made as the nation struggled to come to terms with the violence last week in which five died and dozens were injured. On Monday, the 75-year-old New Jersey Democratic congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman said she had tested positive for coronavirus and believed she had become infected while locked down for hours at the Capitol during the riot last week with colleagues who were not wearing face masks. Coleman is awaiting a more comprehensive Covid test, noting that she had already received the first shot of the two-dose vaccine.
US job market weakens in December, fuelling hopes of more stimulus – as it happened:	Just after Wall Street opened, the main indices hit new all-time highs. The Nasdaq rose more than 100 points to 13,176 while the Dow Jones touched 31,140 and the S&P 500 climbed to 3,824. Over here, the FTSE 100 index is flat, Germany’s Dax is 0.71% higher, France’s CAC has gained 0.5% and Italy’s FTSE MiB is unchanged. Stock markets shrugged off news that the  US economy unexpectedly shed 140,000 jobs in December , the first decline since April, while the jobless rate remained at 6.7%. Investors are betting on more fiscal stimulus from the incoming president Joe Biden, as both chambers of US Congress are now controlled by Democrats. In the eurozone, the unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to 8.3% in November  but youth unemployment rose, to 18.4%.  German industrial production was strong , keeping alive hopes that Europe’s biggest economy avoided a double dip recession. Oil prices have climbed to 11-month highs and bitcoin has hit a new record high. Thank you for reading! Have a good weekend. We’ll be back on Monday. Stay safe - JK The S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq have hit fresh record highs. Trading has begun on Wall Street, and shares are up ! The global economy has just had its worst year of the modern age and 2021 has not got off to the best of starts either,  writes the Guardian’s economics editor Larry Elliott . Yet  stock markets  appear impervious to bad news, with the MSCI world index of developed market shares 10% above its pre-crisis peak. There are a number of reasons why equity markets are so hot. The US dollar erased gains made before the payrolls figures, and is now down 0.09% against a basket of major currencies. Ayush Ansal, chief investment officer at the UK hedge fund Crimson Black Capital, says: The dollar remained fairly resilient in the immediate aftermath of the print as such dire data will reinforce the prospect of the incoming administration reigniting the country with a major fiscal stimulus package. The fact the Democrats now control the Senate, too, gives policymakers in the new administration carte blanche to supercharge the economy and try and move the country on from the unprecedented events on Capitol Hill. Wall Street is now looking forward, to a time beyond Trump, but at the same time market watchers are acutely aware that this is still arguably the most tense time in American political history for decades. In financial markets, European bourses are holding on to their gains, while the FTSE 100 index in London is flat at 6,852. Despite the weakness in the job market, the  US economy  is unlikely to fall back into recession, as a $900bn stimulus programme has been agreed by Congress and the incoming president Joe Biden is expected to expand spending further to prop up the economy. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: The December jobs report marks the first drop in payrolls since April, and an end to the labour market progress that’s been underway since the recovery from the pandemic began back in May. Given the accelerated rise in coronavirus cases recently and the associated drop back in activity, this was not entirely unexpected. Yet it will not go unnoticed by policymakers. With a Blue sweep controlling Congress, further fiscal stimulus is the name of the game and today’s data will only assist that agenda. By contrast, the market reaction to today’s weak data is set to be muted. Investors are already looking through this temporary period of economic weakness and instead focusing on the brighter outlook where fiscal spending, monetary stimulus and mass distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines together ensure the US economy quickly returns to its pre-pandemic path. Here is our full story on the weak US jobs numbers. The recovery in the US jobs market collapsed in December, the last full month of Donald Trump’s presidency, as coronavirus infections soared across the country,  writes Dominic Rushe in New York . The US lost 140,000 jobs in December, down from a gain of 245,000 in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The loss ended seven months of jobs growth with the leisure and hospitality sector once again bearing the biggest losses. The unemployment rate stayed at 6.7%, close to twice as high as it was in February before Covid-19 hit the US. It is also three percentage points higher than the 4.5% rate Trump inherited from his predecessor Barack Obama. In the leisure and hospitality sector, 498,000 jobs were lost in December, taking losses in this sector to 3.9 million since February,  the US Labor Department said . Most of the latest loss (372,000) was at establishments serving food and drink. Other areas fared better: Factory jobs increased by 38,000 after an upwardly revised rise of 35,000 in November. Jobs in construction and retail increased by 51,000 and 120,500 respectively. It is the first decline in non-farm payrolls in eight months, and suggests the US jobs market recovery stalled in December. The fall was largely due to job losses at restaurants, bars, cafes and hotels. Adam Button, chief currency analyst at Forex Live, says : The headline was poor but the positive revisions over the last two months mitigated the damage. The earnings numbers are interesting but I’m inclined to think that’s due to lower wage workers losing their jobs. Average hourly earnings rose by 0.8%, while economists had expected a 0.2% gain. The  US economy  shed 140,000 jobs in December, according to the latest US non-farm payrolls data. Economists had expected an increase of 71,000. However, November’s increase was revised higher to 336,000 from 245,000, and October’s rise was revised to 654,00 from 610,000. The unemployment rate remained at 6.7%. U.S. payrolls shrink in December, by 140,000. Another piece of evidence that the  #economy  was losing momentum as 2020 closed.

A laboratory study by Pfizer and and the University of Texas, which has not been reviewed by peers yet, found that the vaccine can neutralise the virus with the so-called N501Y mutation of the spike protein.

Futures tracking Wall Street’s main indices have climbed to new highs ahead of the US jobs data at 1:30pm GMT. The Dow Jones futures are up nearly 0.3%, the S&P 500 is 0.4% higher and the Nasdaq 0.5% ahead.  All three indices hit record highs yesterday and the S&P closed above 3,800 points for the first time amid expectations of a bigger stimulus package and infrastructure spending once Joe Biden takes office, triggering buying of financial, industrial and material stocks.
Anyone shocked by the US Capitol attack has ignored an awful lot of warning signs:	P erhaps the most powerful shocks, the most painful surprises, are the ones that we saw coming yet refused to believe would happen. Our ability to fear something and, at the same time, assume it will never occur is one aspect of human nature that seems particularly ill-suited to our continued wellbeing and survival. Throughout the 6 January  attack on the US Capitol , as journalists and politicians expressed their stunned astonishment, one couldn’t help wondering: hadn’t they heard about the hundreds of people, some of them armed, who stormed the Michigan state capitol building in  April , objecting to Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home order? Had they forgotten that a  young woman  was killed during the August 2017 Unite the Right march in Charlottesville, Virginia – a neo-Nazi event that Donald Trump declined to unequivocally condemn? Had their interns not been keeping up with – and informing their bosses about – the popular Twitter feeds and Facebook pages of far-right hate groups and extremist conspiracy theorists? Had no one explained that the Proud Boys’ T-shirt insignia – 6MWE – means “Six Million [Jews] Weren’t Enough”? During the assault on the Capitol, as I listened to the panic and horror in the voices of the journalists who, until now, had reported on Donald Trump with something closer to detached disapproval, I wondered: is this what it takes to finally make them understand  who this man is  – and what he wants for our country? What did they think he meant when he tweeted about the gathering planned for 6 January: “Be there. It will be wild.” Even as the “wild” rioters were scaling the walls of the Capitol, some news media persisted in calling them “protesters” and “demonstrators”. These insurgents were far more than that. Images of politicians sheltering in “safe locations” in the Capitol complex reminded me of how, on 13 November 2015, my son – whose band was playing at the Trianon theater in Paris that evening – sheltered backstage while jihadis murdered 89 people at the Bataclan auditorium, a few blocks away. The difference between protesters and terrorists is critical. Demonstrators are expressing their response to a policy, an event or a series of events – systemic racism, for example. But terrorists plot violent mayhem, rehearse, fail, come up with a new plan, try again and again until they succeed. We all recall that the destruction of the World Trade Center was preceded by a 1993 attempt to bomb the WTC parking garage. The attack on the Michigan state capitol and the Charlottesville march were rehearsals for what transpired in DC last week. Donald Trump  is clearly responsible for the 6 January attack. His speech to the crowd that day was an incitement to violence. But it would be a mistake to imagine that the fury and lawlessness of his supporters will disappear when he retires to Mar-a-Lago, goes to jail or begins campaigning for the 2024 presidential election. It’s important to recall that Trump has been the accelerant but not the fuel, not the kindling that has allowed the flames of hatred and bigotry, of anti-democratic rightwing fanaticism to blaze as brightly as they do now. Many of us have a film clip or photo, taken on 6 January, that most haunts us. A friend posted an image of some thugs trying to burn a heap of costly equipment – cameras, recorders, microphones – abandoned, during the rout, by Associated Press reporters. But the image I find most troubling is a short video clip of a dozen or so rioters idly wandering the Senate floor, picking up papers from the senators’ desk, then strolling on.  If these Trump loyalists believe – as they kept chanting – that the duly-elected, soon-to-be Biden-Harris administration is not their government, it’s not only because their president told them so. And the framed portraits, the statuary, the gleaming chandeliers they saw in the Capitol building were unlikely to change their minds. The interlopers on the Senate floor looked less triumphant than bewildered, and their bewilderment is not unrelated to the sources of their rage: the massive income inequality, the epidemic unemployment, the opioid and Covid pandemics, the sense of being excluded and forgotten that helps inspire xenophobia, racism, sexism and violence. The rapid decline of our public educational system and the rise of far-right media are not unrelated; among the things that education gives us is the ability to think, to distinguish the truth from the lie, to process and evaluate the information we’re given. These are the problems and the perils that the Biden-Harris administration will have to deal with, and which all the palliative talk about unity, reconciliation, and “working across the aisle” is not going to come remotely close to fixing. Let’s be clear: the Biden-Harris administration has exactly four years to repair some large part of the damage that’s been done – a short time to begin a massive and necessary project. Otherwise, these violent groups are going to rehearse, retry, recoup, try again and again – until they succeed. With or without Donald Trump, the violence, if it ever goes away, will come roaring back. Lawmakers like Josh Hawley, loudly voicing their objections to the 2020 election results, are already campaigning for the job of anti-democratic dictator in 2024. Unless some substantive changes are made – something more sweeping than the middle-of-the-road policy tweaks that seem to be in the offing – the next coup attempt may very well succeed. And we’ll be left to marvel at something else that we always suspected was possible, but that we never believed would actually happen here, and certainly not to us. Francine Prose is a novelist.

Coronavirus live news: German lockdown could last up to 10 weeks; Ukraine asks EU for vaccine help:	Canada has ordered an additional 20m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, its prime minister,  Justin Trudeau,  has said, after provinces complained about inadequate supplies. Trudeau told reporters Ottawa now had agreements with both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna for a total of 80m doses of their vaccines, to be delivered this year. Canada, which had initially ordered 20m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine with an option for 56m more, now has a firm deal for 40m doses of the two-shot vaccines. The country’s 10 provinces, which have responsibility for administering the vaccines, say supplies are being delivered far too slowly. Trudeau said that, between April and June, Canada would have enough doses for 20 million people. Canada’s population is just over 38 million. Trudeau also said he was extending an existing ban on non-essential travel between Canada and the United States until 21 February. The measures, which do not apply to trade flows, were first imposed last March and have been regularly rolled over. Three  US  lawmakers who had to shelter for safety during the US Capitol riot have tested positive for Covid-19. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state, announced her positive result early on Tuesday, while chastising Republican colleagues who refused to wear masks while they waited in a secured room for more than five hours. The New Jersey representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, also a Democrat, said she decided to get tested because of the possibility of exposure and tested positive. She also tweeted that she was receiving monoclonal antibody treatment – which is still being investigated – on the advice of her doctor. Coleman, 75, is a cancer survivor. Later on Tuesday, Brad Schneider, another Democrat, from Illinois, announced he too had tested positive.

The entry restriction, which does not apply to Spanish nationals and those with legal residency in Spain, will remain in effect until 2 February, the Spanish government said in a statement. Like most European nations, Spain imposed the entry restrictions on 22 December following the discovery in Britain of a new strain of the coronavirus thought to be more contagious. The restriction, initially put in place for two weeks, has already been renewed once for a similar period. The government said it had decided to extend it again because of “some uncertainties over the reach of the new strain” of the coronavirus, the statement said. “The epidemiological situation in the United Kingdom has progressively worsened.” At the same time there has been an increase in Spain in cases “linked to the new strain,” the statement added. About 70 cases of the variant have been detected in Spain, according to the latest health ministry figures. The Italian health ministry has been criticised after a draft of the country’s new pandemic plan revealed medics would be permitted to choose which patients receive life-saving care. This is the first time  Italy  has updated its  pandemic plan since 2006 . The absence of an adequate plan is thought to have contributed to Italy’s coronavirus death toll of more than 79,000. The draft copy of the pandemic plan for 2021-23, seen by the Guardian, stipulates that while health workers are obliged to provide the best and most appropriate care to patients, there are circumstances that may make it necessary to prioritise who to try to save. Page 25 of the plan reads: “The imbalance between needs and available resources may make it necessary to adopt criteria for triage in access to therapies,” and therefore “scarce resources could be allocated in order to provide necessary preferential treatment to those patients who are most likely to benefit”.

Oksana Shelomentseva was hospitalised in the Siberian city of Irkutsk in the 32nd week of her pregnancy, having had a high fever for three days. A scan showed catastrophic lung damage and that her unborn baby was not receiving enough oxygen. “My temperature rose to 38C and I battled with it for three days, but it became clear I could not do that independently,” Shelomentseva said. Doctors immediately performed a Caesarean section to deliver her baby girl Liza, but still feared for the recovery of the mother, who went on to spend almost two months on a ventilator to help her breathe. “It was a very serious case,” said Galina Shkandriy, the head of the anaesthesiology and intensive care department at the hospital where Shelomentseva was treated. The RIA news agency cited her as saying. The entire ward is to thank for the patient recovering from 100% lung damage. When we consulted doctors from around the city, they all said ‘you probably won’t be able to do anything because with those indicators, people don’t survive.’ Oksana spent 51 days in intensive care in a most serious condition. We were able to save her from the most severe lung damage and multiple organ failure. Shelomentseva was discharged on Monday and returned home to her husband and three children, including baby Liza. The  French  government is to provide daily updates on the number of people it has vaccinated after criticism of the  slow pace of its jab programme  compared with other European countries. Health minister Olivier Véran told parliament on Tuesday his ministry would publish a detailed table with the number of people vaccinated per region every evening, Reuters reports. La vaccination, qu’elle se fasse en EHPAD, à l’hôpital ou demain dans les centres de vaccination, est un acte simple. Certains se plaisent à inventer des procédures qui n’ont jamais existé autre part que dans les esprits chagrins, prompts à la polémique. @AssembleeNat   pic.twitter.com/EcJo69vq1y A first list was published on Monday evening, showing that more than 138,000 people have been vaccinated to date, including more than 30,000 in the Paris region. That number is well below the more than 1mn vaccine doses available in France, but Véran said the government would stick to its policy of prioritising the most vulnerable people, even if that meant a slower pace, rather than opting for mass vaccination of all citizens. For now, France is giving priority to residents of retirement homes, but early January it widened that to health staff over 50 or with existing illnesses. Veran said the government was also drawing up plans to make vaccines available to people under 75 who suffer from certain illnesses – with a target of having a total of 1 million people vaccinated by the end of January. He said:  We cannot vaccinate the entire population in one go. Vaccines need to be produced and distributed first.  Veran said that last week, France had 1,080,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in stock and was being supplied with 500,000 more doses per week, which will increase to 1 million per week. On Monday, France had received the first 50,000 Moderna vaccine doses, which will be deployed in areas which face a strong resurgence of the epidemic. Italy  has announced another 14,242 new cases and 612 new deaths from coronavirus. Both figures mark a rise on that tallies announced on Monday, when 12,532 new cases and 448 more deaths were reported. Coronavirus, il bollettino di oggi 12 gennaio: 14,242 nuovi casi e 616 morti  https://t.co/feQ2fIG9op In Europe, Italy is the second worst hit country by the pandemic. Before today’s announcement it had recorded 79,203 deaths, compared to the UK with 82,096, according to the tally run by  Johns Hopkins University . The European Medicines Agency (EMA) did not provide details on which documents or data were made available online, but said necessary action was being taken by law enforcement authorities. Hacking attempts against healthcare and medical organisations have intensified during the pandemic as attackers ranging from state-backed spies to cyber criminals hunt for valuable information. The agency continues to fully support the criminal investigation into the data breach and to notify any additional entities and individuals whose documents and personal data may have been subject to unauthorised access. The watchdog has not so far named the third parties who were affected, but Pfizer and BioNTech announced soon after the EMA’s initial disclosure that documents relating to their vaccine were accessed in the incident. Some Covid-related documents and data that were accessed in a cyber attack have been leaked on the internet, Europe’s medicines regulator has said. It did not provide details on which documents or data were made available online, but said necessary action was being taken by law enforcement authorities. Sweden has registered 17,395 new cases since Friday, taking the total to more than 500,000 cases since the start of the pandemic, as hospitals struggled to cope with a rampant second wave, Health Agency statistics show. The statistics showed that 17 December was the deadliest day since the start of the pandemic with 116 deaths, surpassing a previous peak of 115 daily deaths set in April. More people are being treated at hospitals in Sweden now than at any time during the pandemic. While Sweden still has around 20% spare capacity at intensive care units, there are worries the spread will accelerate again as people return to work and schools after the holidays. Anders Tegnell , the chief epidemiologist, told a news conference: It’s quite obvious that the healthcare system is as strained now (as during the spring). We are near the limit for what the healthcare system can handle. The country of 10 million inhabitants registered 234 new deaths since Friday, taking the total to 9,667. The deaths registered have occurred over several days and weeks with many from the Christmas period being registered with a significant delay. The second wave has also affected how Swedes perceive authorities’ handling of the crisis. In December, 47% said they had relatively high or high confidence in the government’s and agencies’ actions; down from 52% in the previous month. Sweden’s death rate per capita is several times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours but lower than several European countries that opted for lockdowns. More than 70m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech were produced by the end of 2020, the former’s chief executive  Albert Bourla  has said. At the end of the last week of 2020, for example, we had already manufactured more than 70m doses and we had released from there – because there’s a quality control that you need to release – around 50m doses. Then we manufactured more the first week of January. Right now, I think we’ve released 33m doses. And we have, let’s say, half of what we have manufactured sitting on the shelves. BioNTech said on Monday the companies were boosted the 2021 delivery target for their vaccine to 2bn doses, up from 1.3bn previously, as they add new production lines and as more doses can be extracted per vial. Mexico aims to conclude the vaccination of health workers by the end of January, the country’s president  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador  has said. The deputy health minister  Hugo Lopez-Gatell  added that health authorities will move quickly to authorise the use of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. He said: The president has instructed us to proceed speedily on finalising the process of sanitary approval.  Lopez-Gatell, Mexico’s coronavirus czar, said national health regulator Coferis would very soon make its decision on approving emergency use of the Sputnik vaccine and that the country is considering acquiring 24m doses. The deputy minister also noted that Mexico could begin receiving its first batches of a vaccine made by Chinese company CanSino Biologics in February. The president said his government aimed to conclude the vaccination of the country’s health workers by the end of January. The Dutch government is expected to announce a three-week extension of lockdown measures on Tuesday, national broadcaster NOS reported. The prime minister  Mark Rutte  was scheduled to announce the latest social curbs to fight the pandemic. Citing government sources, NOS said the lockdown would be lengthened through the first week of February instead of being lifted on 19 January.   Infections in the Netherlands declined by 12% in the week through Tuesday, to 49,398, Dutch health authorities said, marking the second consecutive week in which cases fell. The National Institute for Public Health said: The falling numbers are the first effect of the lockdown that went into effect on 15 December.   All schools and many stores across the country were shut in mid-December, following the closure of all bars and restaurants two months earlier. Although the infection rate has dropped, the number of new daily cases remains too high to consider easing restrictions, Rutte said last week. His cabinet had considered imposing an evening curfew, NOS reported, but decided against it because of opposition from regional officials. Last Wednesday, a Dutch nurse became the first person in the Netherlands to receive a shot as the European Union’s last national vaccination programme got off to a late start. The Ukrainian president  Volodymyr Zelenskiy  has asked European Union countries for more help in procuring vaccines after his government resisted turning to Russia for assistance. The pandemic has killed more than 20,000 Ukrainians and plunged one of Europe’s poorest countries into recession last year. Ukraine has agreed to buy some vaccines from China and also expects to secure some under the global Covax programme for poorer countries. But it has dismissed calls from a Russian-leaning opposition leader to buy vaccines from Russia. The neighbours are estranged over Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for rebels in eastern Ukraine. During a televised statement while hosting the Moldovan president  Maia Sandu  in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said: Today, for all countries of the Eastern Partnership initiative, in particular Ukraine and Moldova, the issue of obtaining vaccines is important. The countries of the Eastern Partnership should be given increased attention by the EU states in matters of joint procurement procedures and accelerating the supply of vaccines. A week ago, 13 of the EU’s 27 member states jointly urged the bloc’s executive, the EU commission, to do more to help combat the coronavirus in the bloc’s Balkan neighbours and in Ukraine. Sandu came to power in November by defeating Moldova’s Moscow-backed incumbent president  Igor Dodon  and has promised closer cooperation with the EU. Last month, while visiting Chisinau, the Romanian president  Klaus Iohannis  promised to donate 200,000 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to Moldova as a gesture of solidarity following Sandu’s election. India’s Bharat Biotech has signed an agreement with a medicine distributor to supply its vaccine to Brazil, it has said, even as the shot’s emergency use approval in its home country has faced criticism. India’s drug regulator has given emergency use approval to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, as well as to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, known as Covishield in India, which is being produced by the Serum Institute of India. But health experts and opposition lawmakers have criticised approval of Covaxin due to a lack of efficacy data, which the manufacturer is still conducting. Bharat Biotech said it has signed an agreement with a Brazil-based pharmaceutical seller, Precisa Medicamentos, to supply Covaxin. The Indian company said: It is understood between both parties that supplies of Covaxin (are) to be prioritised for the public market, through a direct procurement by the government of Brazil. Criticism of India’s approval of the vaccine has grown after news that a regulatory panel approved the shot just one day after asking the vaccine maker for more evidence it would work. Bharat Biotech, which developed Covaxin with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said supplies to the private market would depend on authorisation from the Brazilian regulatory authority. Brazil has registered more than 8m cases since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen over 203,000, the world’s second-deadliest coronavirus outbreak. Brazil has signed agreements to receive other vaccines. Authorities there are facing growing pressure to speed up the vaccine rollout, which is lagging regional peers. Mexico, Chile and Argentina have already begun immunisations.
'There is no noise': inside the controversial Bhasan Char refugee camp – a photo essay:	I wanted to come here. No one forced me, and my wife also agreed in a snap. To be honest, though, I didn’t tell my brother. He lives where I used to live – Kutupalong camp. He is very against this island for some reason. He might have tried to stop me coming if I dared to discuss the topic. So I didn’t. I only told him after I arrived. I was amazed that he didn’t yell at me. Instead he wondered if he would ever see me again and even got a bit emotional. ‘The children have nothing to do but play. They said school will start soon’ Now when we phone each other, we compare facts and figures. On the island, we get 15kg of rice per head. They get only 13kg in the camps. We get 500g more dal and 1kg more potatoes here too. I am winning so far in our comparisons. We have been here just over one month. We are getting used to it. ‘I heard from one journalist that they spent $350m on this island. He told me I should be happy. I should not complain about anything’ For some reason, I don’t sleep properly. When I lie awake, in the dead of night, I can hear the sea and sometimes the horn of berthing ships. I feel a bit strange then but by the morning that feeling goes away. My children ask if their little friends from our neighbourhood back in the camp will come to the island. I really don’t know what to tell them. I guess they will find new friends here soon when their school starts.  There are tall buildings here. Refugees are not permitted in upper floors. Maybe they think we will kill ourselves? There are a lot of children here, and when they play and get noisy it makes this island feel better, to tell you the truth –and less abnormal. The buildings are all the same here. We live on the ground floor. There are some tall buildings.  Refugees  are not permitted on the upper floors. Maybe they think we will kill ourselves? ‘Right now this place is OK. But with thousands more, I am not sure’ We can only ascend if there is a cyclone. Those floors are used by administration and [for] other purposes. When I think of the camp, I miss getting together with my mates in our favourite tea stalls after Maghrib or Isha prayers. I miss the Burmese tea and coffee mixes we get in the camps like Rich Mix. And I miss  boma   lapase , which you mix with water. That stuff is addictive. ‘Most of the refugees here I think are children. Without children this place would seem even more abnormal’ I feel sad and guilty about my parents. I guess I also abandoned those kids I used to give private tuition to. I worry about them. If I hadn’t fallen into debt and if the thugs in the camp didn’t harass me like they used to – so much so that I feared for my life – I guess I wouldn’t be here. God knows. Most of all, I hope my parents will forgive me some day.  ‘In the camp, there is a lot of noise. Here there is no noise. Sometimes we hear a ship sound. It is very strange’
Indonesia plane crash relative: 'I said I would pray for her':	R afik Yusuf Alaydrus’s wife, Panca Widia Nursanti, messaged him on WhatsApp as she sat on board the  Sriwijaya Air SJ-182 flight . The weather in Jakarta was bad, she said. It was raining heavily and the flight, bound for Pontianak on Borneo island, had been delayed for an hour by the poor conditions. As she waited for takeoff on Saturday, Panca told him she had a bad feeling, and asked him to pray for her. “I tried to calm her down, saying that I would pray for her, and asked her to pray during flight. Inshallah she would be safe,” he said. That afternoon, Rafik drove to the airport in Pontianak to collect her. At 3.30pm he listened for an announcement about the flight’s arrival, but there was none. Airport officers told him they were waiting for information. When Rafik checked online, he saw  news reports that the flight had gone missing . Within minutes of taking off from Jakarta’s main airport, the plane, carrying 62 people, had plunged into the Java Sea. Data from the flight tracker FlightRadar24 showed it had reached an altitude of nearly 11,000ft (3,350 metres) before dropping to 250ft. The cause of the crash remains unclear. The crew did not declare an emergency or report technical problems before the plane’s sudden descent, according to investigators, who believe the plane was most likely intact when it hit the water. The aircraft, a Boeing 737-500, is much older than Boeing’s 737 Max model, which was involved in deadly crashes in both  Indonesia  and Ethiopia. On Monday, Indonesian  navy divers searched for the black boxes , which it is hoped will contain crucial clues as to why the plane went down. So far, plane wheels, part of the plane’s fuselage, landing gear and clothing have been discovered. Human remains have also been found, but there has been no sign of survivors. Panca, a teacher who had travelled to Jakarta to visit her parents, was one of 50 passengers on the flight, which also carried 12 crew. Among those on board were 10 children and babies, pregnant women, a newlywed couple bound for their wedding celebration, and people travelling for business. The plane’s captain was Afwan, 54, who had previously spent a decade flying for the Indonesian air force, according to local media. The profile of one of his social media accounts was reported to be a picture of Superman, accompanied with the text: “No matter how high you fly, you won’t reach heaven if you don’t pray five times a day”. Afwan, a devout Muslim who used just one name, was married with three children. Relatives are anxiously waiting for news. On Monday, the first victim, who was identified by his fingerprints, was named by police as Okky Bisma, a flight attendant. “We hope that there is still hope that we can still bring their bodies home, we can still bury them properly in our home town,” said Slamet Bowo Santoso, whose older brother Mulyadi Tamsir, 40, was on the flight, along with his wife, Makrufatul Yeti Sriyaningsih, and her family. Mulyadi Tamsir had married Makrufatul just months ago, and the couple were about to start a new life together. They had travelled to Jakarta to visit a shophouse, where Makrufatul planned to launch a wedding planning business. On Friday, the last time Mulyadi spoke to his family, he told his mother that Makrufatul was two weeks pregnant. The couple were travelling with Makrufatul’s mother and sister. Mulyadi was an assertive and determined person, Bowo said. “Between the three of us [brothers], only Mulyadi can live in Jakarta, with those harsh conditions of that metropolitan city. We all live in a small city, but he can survive in the big city and build his career there. I will always remember that about him.” Mulyadi was the chairman of the Association of Islamic Students (HMI) in Indonesia from 2015 until 2018, but had since become a politician from the People’s Conscience party, Bowo added. The search for black boxes, which are thought to be buried under piles of sharp debris at the bottom of the Java Sea, continued until darkness fell on Monday. It is hoped that the boxes – which contain recordings of cockpit conversations and flight data – will help investigators determine what went wrong. There have long been concerns over safety in Indonesia’s aviation industry, which expanded rapidly with poor oversight and has been plagued by accidents. As the search continues, some relatives have given blood for DNA analysis so that victims can be identified. Rafik, who has been married to Panca for 23 years, described her as cheerful and funny. A teacher at a vocational high school, she was loved by students because she made them laugh, he said. “They call her ‘guru gaul’ [friendly teacher] because she is really sociable and fun, and she sees her students as her friends,”’ he said. “For me, since she was gone, I still can’t grasp it because I lost her too suddenly,” he said: “But I promised to Allah that I will accept this fate and I will let her go.”
I aspire to give my family opportunities they thought they’d never get:	Name: Jake Turner Age: 19 Dreams of: Being a chef, musician and jujitsu fighter It has been a really good start to 2021. I’ve been working now for about a month and have been loving my new job. I’m running a food preparation kitchen and it’s really helped me keep on track with living a healthy lifestyle. I’m staying at my girlfriend’s family’s house. I’ve watched her mum cook breakfast, lunch and dinner, and a wide variety of foods, while working a full-time job. It’s made me reflect a lot on the bad habits I have had my whole life. It’s completely different and I’ve decided, I need to work so I can show my own family what life can be like. I know I won’t be able to do anything for them without an income. I live with my dad and my brother. They know I’m writing about my life, and their part in it, here. There is no room at my mum and stepdad’s for me to stay, as my two younger siblings live with them, and I respect that. I feel it’s time to grow up. Every time I stay at my own house, though, I feel there’s no hope for something better, like the energy is just too low. There could be so much more. When I come home to stay for work, in my head I just think, why do we live like this? I look around and there’s just clutter everywhere. I feel like, in this house, there isn’t much drive for bigger and better things. Maybe living with my mum from a young age has given me a belief that we all have the capability to get whatever we aspire to. I fear that if I don’t strive for the best, I’ll end up with the same habits as my father and brother. Habits I do not want. Sometimes, after I write my music and do my Tafe homework, I’ll join my brother in his room to play video games. But every time I play video games I get so depressed. Afterwards I realise it’s because I literally achieved nothing and now saying this, I worry that my brother might feel the same way, but just can’t break it.   I’ve tried so hard to bring my brother out of the cycle I feel he’s stuck in. I’m still conflicted with whether it’s a bad thing – to be at him in that way. But I feel as a family working together, we could get so much more than we have. We could start a garden. Help out in community centres. Go for runs to stay fit. It’s not bad, but in the back of my mind, I want things to change, not just for me and my family, but for the whole world, we can make this an even better place. Over the last couple of years I’ve realised I have to be the one to show them that they can do this. That you can have a job and have a healthy life. That you can escape this trap. Do I know if it will work? I’m not sure, but I’m going to try. Yes it’s going to be hard, but I’ve gotten so far in my life and I am determined to not let this defeat me I’m 19 years old and I’m forging a new path of my own. I’ve never been on Centrelink, I am a qualified chef in commercial cookery and am currently doing my certificate 4 studies at Tafe. I’ve been working since I was 16, five days a week. I am in the process of recording my first album in my room and train everyday in mixed martial arts to one day fight in the UFC. I care so much about my family, but I’m going to have to be by myself for a while. I feel I must move out, even with this pandemic happening. I’m not going to let it stop me. What they don’t know is I’m doing this all for them. I aspire to be the one to give my family opportunities they thought they’d never get in their lives. I don’t know why I aspire, maybe while writing this I’ll realise it, but I just feel deep down this is what I’ve got to do. I need to show them there’s more to life than video games and playing on your phone. Things like exercise, study, using your creativity. I have to admit during Covid it’s been very hard to do these things – the exercise and work and that – but it has given me a lot of free time with the creativity side of things. It’s hard to think I might not be training soon as we might have a second round of Covid here in New South Wales, but I’ll always be optimistic. Yes the economy is pretty screwed up, yes a second wave will have an affect on the speed of my progression, yes it’s going to be hard, but I’ve gotten so far in my life and I am determined to not let this defeat me. I want to show my family that anything is possible if you put your mind to it. I want to give them no more worries. I’ll do it all.
