13 Things Every Girl Who Has A Guy Best Friend Is Tired Of Hearing In India:	We all have friends, both girls and boys.

Amul Vs. Neha Tomar: Who Is It At Fault? Or Is There Any?:	image source: dudhsagardairy.coop When as a common customer, we experience a folly from our favorite brand what do we generally do? As a responsible customer, it is both our right as well as duty to bring the authorities to notice the problem faced by us and request them for an appropriate action. This is what a just a commoner of a customer, like you and me, Neha Tomar did. When she experienced some alarming issue with her usual brand of Amul Gold Milk, she lodged a complaint with the Amul people. image source The not so cold war, took an ugly turn when the Amul authorities posted an explanation of the allegations posed on them by Ms. Neha Tomar  on their official Amul page on Facebook. Now, the hurt and disappointed customer is narrating her side of the story, claiming Amul’s allegations to be baseless. Video Source: Amul- This is unfair! What I projected as a concern, being a true consumer of Amul, came to be projected as WAR. On the night of 9 October 2014, my husband bought 3 ltr (6 packets of 500 ml each) of Amul gold milk from a vendor outside our society. It was duly refrigerated, only to be opened by my mother-in-law the next morning. She noticed a sour smell in the first packet, and then eventually in the second one too. She took the rest of the four unopened packet to the vendor, who refused to take it back. Like any other middle class consumer, we thought of making paneer out of it instead of throwing it away. When the milk was put to boil, the look of it changed to a stretchy gooey substance, despite the fact that nothing else was added to it. It was nothing but scary to see that mass, which could have been consumed by my family, including an infant. Being a responsible consumer, I called up Amul customer care where the executive noted down my contact details and told me that some Amul executive will visit me in 4-5 working days. I was taken aback because it was a serious problem and needed immediate attention. The executive mistook me to be overreacting, and disconnected the call without giving any complaint number, even after my asking them for the same. I tried calling again, but lines were busy and I could not get through. It was then that me and my family thought of taking the help of Facebook, which is the most active networking site these days and also has pages of all big brands. I posted details and pictures on Amul’s page, and my own Facebook page on 10 October at 11.55 a.m and again at 11.56 a.m. Amul officials got into action, contacted me and met me on 11 October at 6.30 p.m. However, my post is no longer visible on their page and no new post can be posted too. I humbly attended to and met Amul officials and explained to them my predicament and disappointment. They replaced the milk, and gave me promises that appropriate technical guys will look into the matter and will resolve this. I narrated this whole meeting incident on my Facebook page on 13 October at 10.53 a.m, impressed that the Amul officials were helpful and promised to take cognizance of the matter. Later that evening, 6 Amul officials came to me and explained to me what that stretchy substance could be. However, they accepted that customer care executive was not correct in saying that the complaint will be addressed by Amul officials in 4-5 working days. They informed me that the customer grievances are taken care of by third party and that the Amul head office will look into it. They showed me videos also, which I believed and said that being a layman, I do not know what came from my milk and it is good that they took the effort of explaining the whole reason. I thanked them, happy with the effort they took in addressing the consumer complaint. The very next day, 14 October 2014 at 10.38 a.m., I shared a post again on my Facebook page showing victory and also that how the officials came and met me and explained. And I also praised Amul for its complaints solution and efforts. Like a good consumer I was happy and satisfied in the end. But that same day, Amul posted a post on its page at 3.16 p.m., which read more like a threatening message. Not only were the facts misrepresented, but also the wrong and tampered screenshots of my post were posted. I posted my grievance on 10 October, whereas Amul showed that I posted it on 9 October. This can be seen here . Amul also edited their own post on their page three times with different edited versions. Below mentioned highlighted portions are the edited versions. First post of Amul on their page was posted on 14th October at 3.16 p.m. This is regarding the Facebook post that Ms Neha Tomar has shared on her wall. The details of the matter are as follows: The consumer called our customer care on 10th morning at 9.22 am and shared her experience of using Amul Gold Milk on the very same day. She also emailed the complaint to our official email ID on 10th afternoon. As informed by her, the “use by” date of the Amul Milk was 9th of October. This means the consumer had used expired milk in the first place. It may be also noted that the consumer has been misusing her office to publicize this story on Amul. We hope that she has informed her office regarding the same as we shall hold her office too responsible for her actions. Edited version of first post again posted at 7.10.p.m The consumer called our customer care on 10th morning at 9.22 am and shared her experience of using Amul Gold Milk on the very same day. She also emailed the complaint to our official email ID on 10th afternoon. As informed by her, the “use by” date of the Amul Milk was 9th ofOctober. The milk got expired in her fridge, later used by the consumer. We do not understand that why the consumer used her official position to make such complaint without knowing the fact. See the link for detailed edited posts. Link the link and see the edited section at the post. It is clear how Amul realized that they have threatened me in their first post, thanks to many comments on the thread, and they edited the post. There is no clarification needed for their mala fide intentions. Secondly, I did not give any time promise to Amul officials to upload my feedback. This is a lie and a clear attempt to play with someone’s faith in them and their service, and only to twist facts in their favour. Thirdly, Amul tried to threaten me by involving my office name into highlight which is again totally wrong at their part. I posted everything on my personal level and not on behalf of my organization. Nowhere have I written that I am representing my organization for raising this issue. Nor I have posted my position anywhere. It was clearly mentioned by me that it is my personal experience, and my office has absolutely nothing to do with it. Amul tried to defame the name of my office also, to which they have no right. Fourthly, Amul accused me of having mala fide intentions. Perhaps the first thing I should have done was to sue Amul and claim handsome monetary compensation. That would have defined ‘mala fide’ for Amul officials. But that I did not do. I am not a publicity seeker. Perhaps behaving cooperatively or humbly with Amul officials made them believe that I was an easy consumer to mislead or defame. If indeed I wanted to gain publicity, I would have very initially gone to the electronic and print media. What I did was as an everyday aggrieved consumer, who has seen this brand being used from the very childhood. I had faith in the brand and that’s why I approached the people concerned. I was never having personal grudges against Amul, and there was no reason for it. I was angry on the product, Amul gold milk, which was not up to the required qualitative standard. I brought the issue in the light because nobody takes consumer complaints seriously in India. I took the help of these platforms so that the senior officials and authorities could access the issue and take steps for it being repeated. I stand proud at the step I took and have no guilt at having done so, and the way I did it. The entire country has faith in Amul, and so did I. But the way Amul threatened me was unimaginable. By maligning a consumers image, Amul has only dug its own grave, has ruined the name that has taken so many painful, hardworking years to build. I was an angry consumer and so I took recourse of those platforms, so that my concern could be heard. Adulteration in products is nothing new in India, and milk is a basic daily need of ours. I was scared and terrified after seeing what we were consuming every day. Being a mother, I was terrified with the consequences that could have happened if that milk would have been given to my seven month old daughter, or any other family member. All I expected was a quick and polite response. I am no scientist to know what happens to milk in particular conditions, and a straight forward explanation was all that was needed. No threats. No tampering posts. And no blame games. There is no war between me and Amul. Like an ordinary consumer, I wanted Amul to solve the matter, and also being a big brand they have some accountability towards customer grievances. But the way they solved and manipulated the whole issue was totally unexpected and hurting. I happily posted everything good about Amul on Facebook after their response in appropriate time. Being humble is the quality of the wise; threatening a vice of the arrogant/ ignorant. Just this one mistake from a few officials has not just soiled the brand name, but also lost many good consumers. I would have been very happy if Amul would have ended this on an amicable note. A proof of which is over one lakh people who shared the post on Facebook and shared their comments and observations. A brand is made by its consumers; it is never the other way around. I could have taken legal measures to respond to the public threat by Amul, but I did not, because I do no hate Amul. But Amul Gold milk has lost its customers, one is me. As a regular Customer of Amul products, I only tried to bring to the notice of the Customer Care and management an issue which needed immediate attention. It was construed by Amul Management that I was working on behest of other Corporate, and I had malafide intentions. I never expected this kind of response from Amul, a brand I have grown up consuming in various forms. It is sad day for consumer rights! [mashshare]

The Relentless Snapdeal Soap Affair..This Will Tell Us How Materialistic We Have Become:	images source Yeah folks, that’s right! A Mr. Lakshminarayan Krishnamurthy was one such lucky brute who got to sway high with such a thoughtful and personalized treat when he ordered a mobile phone from one of India’s biggest online shopping portal, snapdeal.com . Oh no. Snap! You can’t take away the credit! It was all the effort put into by a thoughtful courier man or a seller, not you! Evidently, Mr. Lakshminarayan ordered a Samsung phone for his wife, trying to make use of Snapdeal’s Diwali Bumper Sale; but as it turned out some jolly good fellow in the festive spirit of Diwali switched the phone with a Vim bar to give him a Diwali Dhamaka!! My! What a brilliant idea to surprise somebody and at the same time connect at such a personal level! image source Anyway, unable to understand the pure soul, the naive customer got a little upset over the the Samsung box containing a used up dish washing soap-bar instead of a fresh one! Sigh… Some people can just never be pleased. C’mon man! That’s the beauty of the prank…it was a humble attempt to connect to the customer with the daily lives of the retailer. Nevertheless, Snapdeal came up to be a spoilsport and refunded the whole amount apparently “good-heartedly”. Not only that, even Hindustan Unilever Company gifted him with the Samsung Core Duo mobile phone along with Vim Liquid soaps! Can you believe that?

5 Fun Ways To Spend Father’s Day:	Aren’t our Fathers the best thing that has happened to our lives? As much as we love our mom’s, we can never imagine a life without our Dad, can we? In fact, If it weren’t for him, we would have never had the life that we have today. He chose time over money and you over anything else in this planet every single time. Yeah!! We know he might not show his love for you like your mom, but do you really expect him to do that. So this Father’s day let’s do something for the man who can take down any superhero with a single punch – your Father! Here are 5 fun ways you can spend this Father’s Day with your Dad. Remember the first time when our Dad took us to the nearest theatre and introduced us to this amazing thing called movies. Since then, we must have sat through hundreds of movies and have also started binge watching on weekends. So, it’s high time that you thank him by taking him out for one. But since its falls on Sunday, his only rest day, you can also choose to stay put and binge watch movies with him. I would advise taking turns while deciding on the movies to watch on Father’s Day . Take him out for brunch , and this time around let him choose from the menu. Nothing tops food and that is why we put this point right after movies. Also, as we suggested in the previous point, if you are planning to stay put with your Dad and binge watch movies, then do it the right way by ordering in some pizzas. We can bet that for most of us, it’s our Dad who taught us how to throw a ball or the dos and don’ts of your favorite sport. We think maybe it’s time we show our gratitude by spending this Father’s day with him, playing it. Also, remember to go a little soft on the old man. We are not asking you to lose but maybe not win this time. Come on, that’s the least you can do for him. Going through old photos: No! Keep your phone aside and take out the photo album from the closet. Trust us, we know that your screen is hi-res, but it will never strike you with nostalgia like an old photo does, that you thought you lost while moving forward in life. We are pretty sure that this is going to put a smile on his face. Or better, look back at some of his old pictures and see how great you Dad used to look. Tell him about the girl or boy you like, just kidding, don’t do that, unless of course, it’s the right time. But do you sit down for a coffee with your Dad anymore or tea, whatever floats your boat? Talk about those cherished memories or foolish memories and laugh over it?  This might get a little emotional, so we would advise keeping some tissues handy. Like we said at the beginning of the article, Every Father is a SuperHero , and we just cannot stress more on that. So, on this Father’s Day, let’s treat him like one.

11 Best Winning Moments In Indian Cricket:	Cricket in our country is nothing short of a religion, with Sachin Tendulkar as the God himself. This epitomizes the madness of cricket in India. Here we live again some of the greatest winning moments that every Indian has witnessed and have made them proud. Nobody gave India a chance against the fearsome West Indies pace attack but a rookie Sunil Gavaskar led the Indian charge and ultimately to a famous series win. image source   India came in as the underdog with West Indies looking to complete the hattrick of World Cups, but like in earlier one, the West Indies juggernaut was halted by determined and dogged Indians led by mercurial Kapil Dev. image source   Many considered India’s victory in the 1983 World Cup as a fluke, but victory in final against the arch rival Pakistan cemented India as the force to reckon with. image source   It was the second World Cup in India and Bangalore witnessed the pulsating quarter final between India and Pakistan which India went on to win with young Ajay Jadeja demolishing Waqar Younis still fresh in every Indian’s mind. image source   It was Tendulkar against the Australian team. The master blaster single handedly led India to one of its most memorable victories. image source   Australia won the opening test match in Mumbai and was on its way in Kolkata as well. But what we saw after India was forced to follow on was an absolute master class from VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid. Their heroics not only bailed India out of the trouble and made likes of McGrath, Warne and Gillespie look ordinary but along with Harbhajan Singh made sure India won the test and level the series 1-1, which India ultimately won. image source   Chasing 325 runs to win, India was struggling at 146/5 with all the big guns back in the pavilion and not much could be expected from new comers like Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif. But what transpired after that is considered on the greatest one day comebacks of the modern times. Yuvraj and Kaif (not out till the end) along with the tail enders’ took India to a famous victory. image source   Some consider this innings by Rahul Dravid which gave him the nickname “The Wall”. He single handedly took on the Australian attack and scored a wonderful double hundred in the first innings and a gritty 70 odd not out in the second innings that took India to victory and also not to forget the spell Ajit Agarkar bowled to skittle Australia out for less than 200 in second innings. image source   Mahendra Singh Dhoni led a very young and inexperienced Indian team to its maiden T20 World Cup that helped lift the gloom over the Indian cricket which had surrounded after a dismal 2007 50 over World Cup. image source   India registered arguably one of its most famous overseas test victories when they defeated Australia in Perth (considered to be the fastest pitch in the world) and gave the Aussies a test of their own medicine. image source   Sachin Tendulkar after all those years of sacrifice and sheer determination led India to their second ICC 50 over World Cup, thus giving billions of Indians a reason to smile and to be proud of. image source

Chris Gayle Slams Selectors For Pollard And Bravo But No One Stood Up For Yuvraj:	West Indies cricket board and Clive Lloyd-led selection panel announced list of 15 members squad for Cricket world cup 2015 which did not include two West Indian all rounders Kieron Pollard and Dwayne Bravo.  After playing a match winning knock of 90 runs in the second t-20 match against South Africa Chris Gayale hit out at selectors for emission of two most experienced all rounders from the West Indians side and labeled this emission as “ ridiculous “. Gayle said . ” That’s really sad for us. Its really a big blow for us to actually loose two key players and two key all rounders as well who are also good in the out field.  I do not know what is the history behind it but its RIDICULOUS selection from my point of view. I do not know where out cricket is heading with this sort of situation but its really sad.  It really heart, but I am glad that we won this series for Pollard and Bravo. For me it looks like victimization for those two guys.. Its sad!! Common guys, its  RIDICULOUS..i mean RIDICULOUS..it really hurts RIDICULOUS…honestly. I spoke to Bravo, and he told me that the team which we have build for the World Cup is actually rebuilt for the next World cup which I can’t understand what Bravo is telling me as this team is not selected to win the World Cup but basically rebuild it for the next World Cup.. which is RIDICULOUS and I can not just understand what Bravo told me.” source: cricinfo.com featured image source I’m just thankful. Bravo & Pollard – Long Live The King!! Can’t and won’t keep a good man down! http://t.co/K4FHCSBlSc — Chris Gayle (@henrygayle) January 11, 2015 When Indian board selectors left out Yuvraj Singh in the final 15 world cup squad even after scored three back to back centuries in the Ranji trophy matches. No one from the Indian team stood up and spoke about what they feel after the same. They even did not react on inclusion of Stuart Binny in the final 15 for the world cup.

How to choose the best online betting site?:	As online gambling has only ever increased its popularityamong punters, more and more online betting sites have cropped up that offeryou incredible value for very little effort. It is said that the search for theperfect online betting site is like having a little adventure , and for many, adventurescan be daunting. Thus, the best online betting sites in India , is sure tohelp you narrow your search as much as possible. There are several key themes that determine what makes anonline betting website good. The more tick boxes each site ticks the better. Wehave covered what we think are the most vital concerns that one may have while choosingan online betting website. Gambling, including its online iteration, has to deal withlegal issues. There are a lot of regulations that concern gambling . Games areoften divided into games of skill and games of chance, and the latter arebanned in several nations, as they fit more into the idea of betting than theformer. Often, online casinos try to violate established regulations, puttingthe customer at risk. In a few ways, online gambling might be safer than itsoffline counterpart, as it eliminates misinformed bookies, but even then, itnever hurts to be safe. While it is not always possible to know every possiblelaw in the book regarding gambling, some quick research about what is allowedand what isn’t goes a long way in keeping you safe. In theory, if a gambling website is good, you should neverhave to resort to customer service at all. However, things are rarely, if atall ideal, and a good customer service goes a long way in ensuring a goodexercise in betting online. What you should be looking out for, while gamblingonline include: There are several varieties of customer care services that are offered. Thesecan range from simple emails to calls to a team of customer support. Some sitesoffer live chat-based customer services, which means that these sites areobviously better in the way they approach customers and there also existsguaranteed response to your question. The problem with emails is that they takea long time to get replies from, while calls have no guaranteed response.Moreover, most betting queries are minor issues that can be resolved by asolitary quick question and do not need a call or an SMS. Thus, websitesoffering live chats are often preferred. Online casinos often have reward systems in place that seekto incentivise players to continue on their site, instead of rival websites.These seek to improve your chance of winning, increase your pay-outs or sometimes even do both. The methods in place includesign ups and referral bonuses for first time gamblers to a website, as well asscore multipliers for veteran punters. Free bets may also be offered where youcan play a risk-free hand and also keep the pay-outs. These bets although, aremostly lost. The most exciting of these offers though, is the increased odds ofwinning. They tend to modify the probabilities the game is based on, resultingin a higher odd tailored to you, so that you have a higher propensity to win agame. Sometimes offers can be clubbed together, making winning even better. Sites which offer variable payment options, covering mostkinds of credit cards, mobile wallets, UPI etc. are always preferred. Immediatedeposits are more often present on sites and need not concern you. Withdrawals are a different headache. Most sites will notlet you withdraw funds once deposited, requiring the entire money invested inthe site to be gambled, often a frustrating experience. For sites that are okaywith withdrawals, quite a few of them take an unending amount of time todeposit the money back to your bank account, which is always a cause ofanxiousness. Thus, your choice should be restricted to sites that give you backyour money within one to three working days of making the request for awithdrawal. Probably the most helpful guide in your choice of the perfect gambling website, is the opinion previous gamblers have about a particular website. Reviews can exist both online and offline. You can ask your peers and colleagues who gamble, about a particular site, or take their recommendations for the best sites, based on the games you want to play. Internet review websites exist, where punters comment on their personal experience with regards to gambling, and it always helps to only restrict yourself to websites that have most, if not all, favorable reviews.

Is this India’s Best Bowling Attack in Last 2 Decades?:	It is notsurprising to infer the importance of sports in one’s life—right fromgerminating stages, rural India has pushed its children right into the kabaddiground, or maybe in a kite-flying competition, whilst urban India took tohorse-riding, or polo—the ones meant for the esoteric masses, basically. However,there is one game of sports that is a common ground for both aforementionedsections of the country—cricket. The importance cricket plays in the life of anIndian is dividend of the fact that cricket is not just hailed as a game, buthas taken the role of something as astound as the culture of the country—as isevident from the unity one can observe during cricket matches, or in moments that etchitself in history books . Through innumerable victories and losses—Indians have always felt united in times of cricket matches, especially national ones. Similarly, what isn’t surprising is the credibility of the current generation bowling attack—whilst or armchair analysts at 10Cric.com might argue that the bowling attack two decades ago was rather intimidating, there is substantial evidence that the current Indian bowling attack is not just promising, but oozing with potential. While thebowling front led by Kapil Dev might have had a fair amount of success, thereis no denying that the current Indian bowling line-up has proven to beexponentially more effective. Here are a few key elements that have proven tobe profitable for the Indian cricket team, and the individuals responsible forthe success of modern-day bowling in the country. If one isbeing brutally honest, there is no denying that Jasprit Bumrah is possibly thebest fast bowler the country has had in decades. It is a common misconceptionto assume that fast bowlers lack intellectual prowess, and are just about brawnsans brain, but Bumrah proves otherwise; while he has a reputation ofshattering the stumps to oblivion , he is also known to exercise a great deal of intellectduring matches, especially during death overs. Being anexpert in limited-overs format, Bumrah has shown time and time again thatvariable pace and consistent line and length is the key to success—sticking tobasics goes a long way—and this is even more apparent in the IPL where he isfamous (or infamous, depending on which team you support) for conceding aminimum number of runs due to incessant yorkers. Either way, Bumrah can becredited as the single-most important reason why the current bowling attack ispossibly the best the world has seen in decades. It may beslightly unfair to tag Ishant Sharma as a “veteran” per se, considering howconsistent he has been over the span of the entire decade, but there is nodoubt in the fact that Sharma has been a boon to the Indian bowling side. Whileone might have witnessed his recent fantabulous performance in theIndia-Bangladesh test series, it is just a small example of how useful he hasbeen to the Indian side over the entire course of his career, and can berightfully held as one of the pioneers of modern-day fast-paced bowling—thereis no doubt that Sharma is one of the most important reasons why the currentgeneration Indian bowling is so dominant, and why the current bowling ispossibly the most successful in their endeavours. While thepost of Chanakya in politics might becontroversial, there is no doubt that in the Indian cricketing scenario,Yuzvendra Chahal takes the cake. With his sleight of hand and deceptive action,it becomes difficult to read what bowl Chahal will be bowling next—making him asintimidating and effective as his fast-paced counterparts, if not more. He is also known to have a cooltemperament , and him staying calm and collectedhas also resulted in squeezing matches out of losing-lane, no matter howminuscule the margin. Chahal is equally effective in the fieldingdepartment—making him one of the most important assets of modern-day Indianfielding. While the previous generation of bowlers witnessed the spectacularspells of Anil Kumble, there is no denying that Chahal, in his own ways, hasbeen spectacular with both bat and particularly with the ball, making themagician one of the reasons why Indian bowling attack of today is possibly thebest the country has ever witnessed. There might be individual contributions to claim the effectiveness of Indian bowling of today. However, another reason that makes Indian bowlers of today better than any other generation is their efficiency in the field too. A doosra might lead to taking a teesra wicket, but the fundamentals of cricket still remain the same— catches certainly win matches . Featured image source 
15 Signs Show You Will Have A Wonderful Partner:	When you have been single from times unknown and while all your friends are mingling you obviously start thinking you will but remain single all your life (and sighh… secretly thanking your Indian origin parents who still believe in arranged marriages). But as ironic as it may sound, a black comedy of sorts, rejoice in the fact that even if you are single now there is little chance you will remain so even in the future if you have the following traits. Being an adult doesn’t mean you have all your sh*t sorted out. Yet even paying your own bills counts. You could be happy and bubbly at play but that doesn’t hinder you from taking sensible decisions and performing your duties seriously. You are at ease with taking responsibilities for your own actions even if that means you having to say sorry to someone.   Who doesn’t know how they want their partner to be, right? Wrong. Most people have a kinda sorta idea of how they want their partner to be with adjectives making up for their expectations like, ‘she must be smart’, ‘he will be considerate’ etc etc. But if you know specifically what you want in your partner like if you want them to be passionate about their goal in life or want them to be an avid reader, well, you are more likely to find such a person.   Loving yourself isn’t being selfish. If you put your partner’s needs before you all the time and keep taking care of the world but you then it is only going to result in you being upset, resentful and drained. So, if you give your own self-care the priority and truly love yourself then it is more likely your zest for life would attract the right person.   As important it is to know what you want in your partner so is to know  your own likes and needs. If you are comfortable with yourself and know very well if you love or hate something or what ticks you off, you can find the right person who can make your needs met and lead a happy relationship with you.   You have a life of your own with your own priorities. You have ambition, hobbies and may enjoy hanging out with your goofy friends or taking a dance lesson. So, the bottom line is you don’t want to be saved from your present life so that you can be happy(ier) in your imagined future life with your bae. You don’t want someone to change your world, you only want someone to be a part of it.   You are not onto a project to rehabilitate someone. As much as you love your own space and freedom so do you honour others’. So, instead of wanting someone so you can mould to fit your style, you would accept them as they are and compromise.   A relationship needs to be capable of free flowing love to and fro. And for that reason you need to be willing to be physically and emotionally present for them in their times of need and commit to the relationship without trying to keep your option s open.   If you have it in you to listen to your talkative friend go on and on about her boyfriend or your dad rant about how irresponsible you are without interrupting them you are definitely a good listener. So, if you are open to be courteous and thoughtful by listening to them rather than rolling your eyes or checking your phone every minute you have one of the most important traits in you of a good beau that usually people lack.   Rather than being painfully diplomatic or passive-aggressive, you are known to give your thoughts the words they need. You can state clearly and effectively what you want and need rather than playing games and telling them instead what you don’t want.   You know you have flaws. Who doesn’t? But the best part is you are aware of them and don’t get queasy. Being bothered by your shortcomings is a great way to break your self confidence. You on the other hand are open to look like and idiot sometimes, being emotionally vulnerable and also making mistakes. It is better to be comfortably you than pretend to be someone else. It is after all the perfect recipe to attract someone who may truly like you.   A relationship is all about equality. It is what keeps it healthy and fresh. It is about the responsibilities and rights too that need to be equally shared between the two of you. When you aren’t stuck up and pay the bill telling your date to get it next time, you are more likely to win a great partner.   If you are okay with losing a game with your friend sometime and genuinely appreciate their skill then you don’t feel the incessant need to prove yourself every time and so is your ego in check. This is very essential in a relationship too. Fights are common in a relationship and those don’t necessarily mean the end. Instead of getting bitter and planning on a revenge, you adore their winnings and accept your defeat, helping you both to jump back quickly to being happily crazy again.   While you may not actually love to say the ‘sorry’ word it is something you can do because you hold relationships more important than your ego. The same goes when others make a mistake and you forgive them. This is what keeps any relationship resent free and loving.   You do not take anybody or any of their gestures for granted. You appreciate their doings for you no matter how small. Who wants to be taken as for granted in a relationship anyway? So, this is how you show them what they are worth by telling them thank you and doing something for them as well from time to time. Featured Image Source
Should A Girl Expect Her Date To Be A Gentleman:	Gentleman. What or who is he? Google describes a gentleman as someone who is a chivalrous, courteous or an honourable man. Hmm… interesting. And what’s interesting is that it is something that every girl wants, isn’t it? Perhaps ‘Are you kidding me?! Of course yes!’ or perhaps  ‘Mmm…. I don’t know’. While most of the girls (and truthfully) will go with the first answer, some like me would go for the second. The reason? Well, the second Google definition may help shed some light on it. It says, ‘gentleman’ is a polite or a formal way of referring to a man. For all those who are still batting their eyelids, with a huge question mark hanging above their heads, it simply means we assume or bestow this title on someone. That someone who is courteous or rather who fits the age old picture of the fathomed ideal man. A man who would be considerate enough to lift a heavy bag for a girl or who would willing volunteer to squish a spider that scared you Miss Muffet away. While these all seem like dreamy and gorgeous ways to make you feel like a delicate damsel, let’s not forget they are also the ancient norms of behaviour for men, jotted down by the same born octogenarians who also set certain rules of conduct for the ‘ladies’. While you are so fiercely fighting tooth and nail for your own rights of equality why do you think it is okay to let the men be left shackled in their old school? The women are shouting out slogans everyday to empower them, let them wear what they like, be out till whatever time they feel like and be given equal positions and wages at their jobs. Then why do you still expect the guys to pay the bill every single time you go on a date? Why would you prefer he pull the chair for you? And why would you remain seated till he walks all the way over to your side to open the car’s door? Some of these gentlemanly ways are nice and do make you feel respected and courteous like offering a seat to a pregnant lady in the crowded metro or greeting your mom with a namaste . And some others like talking in a polite manner are just good etiquettes. These can and should be a part of anyone’s character, be it a girl or a guy. But other than these, matters like him wearing baggy shorts, fashioning long hair or getting tattooed shouldn’t be considered as indecent or anti gentleman actions. The guys too need freedom just like the women do. Undue expectations from a guy in the name of gentlemanly antics is not only injustice but also far fetched as far as dating is concerned. After all don’t you like it when a guy is playful, witty and pulls your leg? Don’t you want him to give you the space to go anywhere without him putting a tab on you in the name of protection? And won’t you like to give them a treat when you get promoted? The expectations or rather the rules the society has enforced on the guys has led you to think it is the only criteria to identify the nice guys from the rest of the rotten tomatoes. For all you know he could only be donning the said ‘gentleman’ façade only to get in your pants. So, be the change. Look beyond the societal standards and learn to look deep into a guy’s core to pick out the one who is actually nice minus the unnecessary frills. And lest you know, chivalry isn’t dead, though unfair presuppositions should be. Featured Image Source : 50 Firstdates movie

I’m not telling you to follow Charlie Chaplin and keep making people laugh and cry when it rains so nobody can find out you’re sad. What I’m saying is that being sad is fine. Being upset is also fine. And so is being angry. These are as much part of life as is a smile, a laugh or a giggle. But don’t be a person who has secretly vowed to the Sacred Society of The Frown Brothers. Or Sisters, doesn’t matter. If you are annoyed or upset over something, no person can be better than your beau to pester with your tear tales. But the process must not be as common as the frequency of you taking your selfies in the loo. Okay, so you got it now. When you have a low self esteem or are unhappy with your own life, it clearly reflects in your relationship as well. If it becomes more of a constant routine, it starts affecting both of your lives and the relationship as well making it dull and painful. What you bring then to your dinner table is not the dazzling smile that lights up the atmosphere but something that turns it into a gloom fest. Do not misunderstand though. Your partner is meant to be there with you in all your happy and sad times with special reference to the sick ones when you have had a tad too much. But then they are there because they love you, which if we take out the clichéd Bollywood version of love at first sight, clearly translates into seeing you happy and smiling always. Now, by the same logic doesn’t that apply to you as well? If you want to see them happy and by a totally not far- fetched extension, your relationship, you need to start loving yourself first. How on earth can you ever imagine otherwise to love and take care of an another human being? And forget being thoughtful or romantic then! Being happy is not that a Herculean task either. Whatever that they say about meditating, taking a walk in fresh air, doing yoga or sharing your meal with your loved one is bogus, except it’s not. Do these and try to be content with your life. And when you do have to face untoward situations, please contact your beau. They’ll just be a call away to be there for you. Now, that’s another reason to smile, isn’t it? Featured Image Source
8 Signs Of A Truly Trendy Girl And How To Cope With Dating Her:	Who doesn’t love a trendy girl? The girl rules every heart with her perfect look that’s the craze of the day. A trendy girl is not necessarily obsessed about fashion and latest trends but sure does love keeping herself chic and looking beautiful all the time. And why not, that’s her right, isn’t it? So, if you are hooked onto her, this is what you need to know about her and how to cope dating her. 1. She wants to look all; sometimes cute, others trendy and still others plain beautiful… so unless you can figure that out from her look of the day and deliver appropriate responses/praises, you don’t have it in you to qualify as her boyfriend. Eros International   2. This is the reason why you need to garner patience and brave the mini-fashion shows she would entertain you with after each session of shopping , which mind you would be quite frequent. image source / Featured Image Source / Dharma Productions   3. Zara and Pantaloons vouchers will always be welcome be it it for her birthday, anniversary or the numerous you-love-her days. image source   4. You should always be ready to freeze to almost death on winter night dates for she will never hide her cute dress she just bought for some lame idea of saving herself from cold winds, until of course she feels the cold and spots you! image source / Yash Raj Films   5. She is going to spend all her food money too on boots , so be ready to sympathise and occasionally lend her money for a new peplum dress or even a designer poncho. image source   6. As long as it’s trendy and in fashion, she’s going to try it all so don’t freak out if you see her one day in something you can’t make head or tail of or her hair dyed in mermaid hues. Yash Raj Films   7. Don’t be alarmed if she takes an hour in the loo every time she excuses herself from your ongoing date. She’s just doing touch up of every make-up article she has on her and taking selfies after each application. So, chill and eat your soup. image source   8. And she will say she doesn’t have anything to wear a lot. And so, even though you know it isn’t true, just be nice an nod your head but don’t ever try to pull out something from her wardrobe or advice her to wear the dress she wore in some party the other night. image source

It’s Either White Or Black In A Relationship. Not Grey.:	There’s this cute guy in your class with whom you grab a bite now and then. He asks you out often to catch a movie with him and you think or rather wish you are the only one he calls to for that. But of course you aren’t sure and even more than that can’t fathom asking him so. Similarly, he could be seeing this lovely girl next door who may call her to fix broken things or hang out after the gym but he has no way to know if that’s because they have something between them or if he’s just an another guy friend to her. Or worse…. he and maybe even you could be ‘on the hook’. If this is going on for a while now and you still can’t define this ‘thing’ between you two and aren’t even sure if it’s exclusively with you or the guy/the girl that you are kinda seeing now is actually seeing someone else too on the side (or behind your back), one thing is certain, you are my friend in the ‘grey’ area. You know, that gloomy shade that’s somewhere between the black and the white? You are certainly in that. Oh no. Don’t dare take it as something good. ‘Grey’ can be and probably is sexy and desirable only in the erotic novel, not in the real life. You are no Anastasia Steele and that grey area I’m talking about is nowhere close to Christian Grey either. In fact it’s something that you must be wary of from the start. Courtship period is something everyone desires and enjoys too. The uncertainty there is nice in its own unique way. That’s what makes you blush and excited at the same time. It’s actually healthy for a relationship to begin. But that’s the twist. It is good when you have at least this much of certainty that this half baked relationship (if it’s even that), that’s spurring between you is going somewhere. You have a feeling then that he/she may only be shy and not yet ready to commit yet but yes you know that there is definitely a green signal somewhere down the road that will be visible once you drive down the lane a bit further. But if that person is available at his/her own will alone, calls you to make plans only at the last moments and stays off the grid for long and without a warning beforehand, then be assured you are not reaching any green light. Believe it or not there’s not even a road ahead to reach anywhere. It’s the dead end or something far worse, it’s that darn Blair Witch Project that will make you go round and round but return you to the same spot with no progress whatsoever. For some, this could be a dream come true. With no strings attached and apparently no psycho girlfriend/boyfriend to put a noose around your neck, they are a free bird to wander and yet have a home to come back to. But unlike these, most of you who need and want something real, someone to actually call your man or your girl, to rely on, feel cared for and have some stability in life; it can prove to be a living nightmare. Being in the ‘grey’ area eats you up; at least emotionally it does. Most crave the more certain and relaxing black or white zones; a defined area which allows you to label them as ‘yours’; if black, then your friend (or the top name on your hit list) and if white, congratulations you got yourself a bae! So, getting stuck in the dull, gloomy, emotionally breaching and frustrating synonym for hell is no choice. Instead of sleeping on a wet sponge of a pillow and blaming and questioning yourself fruitlessly in the shower, gather some courage and shoot the question on them instead. At least they aren’t mute like your shower curtain; they’ll definitely have something to say. Good for you or bad that’s secondary. But anyway it’s always the best to define your relationship and mingle happily or even to stay single some more and enjoy the free and me time till you find the right one. Featured Image Source

14 Commandments Of Dating A Go-Getter You Should Never Break:	A go-getter is someone who knows what he wants and how to get it. He is ambitious, workaholic and doesn’t and can’t stop at anything to achieve his goal. A go-getter has his aim sorted out and his passion is fiery. If you are dating or want to date someone like that, you should better get acquainted and accustomed to some of his ways which may seem cold and selfish from a distant look but are in fact nothing more than a reflection of someone who is passionate about his dreams. Here are 14 commandments that you must clearly understand and not break at any cost if you want to date this go-getter. image source / Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures He is making the best of his time to achieve his dreams, which is his foremost goal and then to be with you in the left time because he wants to be with you. So, questioning his liking for you on the basis of the amount of time he spends with you is not the right way to look at the relationship.   When there are two things that need his attention, his work and his relationship. He’ll pick the former one first always. That’s not because he does’t care but only because his work is his priority.   He isn’t the commitment type of a guy so trying to force that out of him is not going to work. Solution? Let him breathe, get comfortable and do it in his own sweet time.   He’s the type of guy who doesn’t have time for games. If he does commit to you it mean he really enjoys your company as much as he enjoys his work and given his love for his work, that’s a big thing. So, instead of doubting him on the basis of his priority or the amount of time he spends over work, is only duping yourself.   There will be a lot of business talk, project ideas and work humour when your are with him. It may sound like gibberish to you but he’s actually sharing his most loved passion with you and that’s all because he feels you are an important part of his life.   It will be a common scenario for him to suddenly transfer into a completely different zone when he hits on a solution for a work problem while in a conversation with you. What’s important to know here is that, it’s not because he’s not interested in what you are saying but because work is more than just a part of his life, so it is always on his mind.   He can celebrate his success for a day or two but don’t expect him to linger onto that forever. The next instant he’ll be at his workstation to give himself a reason to celebrate an another victory with you. You may think he is exhausted but in reality, this is just how he keeps going.   His work needs his undivided attention. Stopping to talk to you only breaks his train of thought which is bad for his work. So, wait till he finishes because he blocks away every noise and other disturbing elements just to concentrate well on his work.   When dating a go-getter, there is a lot of future plans in the conversation. He is so interested in the future because it helps him to keep his mind clear and him focussed on his goal. So, if he isn’t dwelling on the past memorable moments you shared or talking about the present, it doesn’t necessarily mean you aren’t in his future plans.   He doesn’t need something to get rid off his loneliness or boredom and he isn’t there because it’s convenient for him. If that had been the case, he would have been working rather than being with you. Right? If he chooses to hang out with you than bury his head in his project, it’s actually because he likes to be with you above and beyond anything else.   Go-getters are intellectual people. He would appreciate it more if the date be productive and fun at the same time than be the routine movie and dinner date. For him, an ideal date is more about taking different classes together, travelling somewhere, attending business conferences and fairs and reading books or magazines side by side and perhaps having an interesting discussion or even a debate.   The fact that he hangs out with you, shares his deepest passions and dreams with you is because he wants, rather needs his partner’s support. So, instead of shutting him out for being too workaholic or selfish, try to be understanding and support him in his endeavours.   There is nothing more boring to him than a girl who doesn’t have a life and aspirations of her own. Live your life, enjoy it and  work up your passion because that’s what he truly respects and seeks in his beau. If you can be ambitious yourself and appreciate him too for for that, there is no denying he will be so much devoted to you.   He may already be successful or may have everything in him to be so. So, if you always dreamt of being with someone with power and the courage to earn that, a go-getter is one for you.
19 Things About A Carefree Girl That Make You Thank Your Stars That You Are Dating Her:	It is a common thing for a person to find himself drawn to his stark opposite.

9 Signs Of A Truly Equal Relationship:	A happy relationship calls for equality between the couple.

12 Things To Keep In Mind When Dating A Girl Who’s A Party Hopper:	She is a queer and unique person who definitely has some very different ways of life. When the others tuck themselves into their beds, she revs up her car’s engine to join her league in a night of incessant dance and booze. So, if your girlfriend is this girl, congratulations, you are already in a world of a party hopper’s crazy, fun and nightless days. Like every relationship, a relationship with a party animal too is full of turns and twists, and often unusual ones too. You can learn to get accustomed to your girl’s colourful and loud lifestyle the hard way from experience or you can read the following list and help yourself to fit in and make your relationship with her, a success. image source / Eros International If you are not the party type person and yet she is dating you, she must really like you for your laid back charm. But that doesn’t mean you have to overdo it. You must still try to be outgoing for her.   Just because you return home right at 8pm, while she chooses to stay up late partying with her friends, doesn’t imply you are better.   Of course it doesn’t need to be only you trying to fit in her crazy night schedules; she too must make compromises and amendments in her lifestyle for your sake but trying to change her for your own selfishness is not good either.   A party hopper has her calender overstuffed so forgetting your date or getting late for it sometimes is on the menu. Save yourself the disappointment and headache by checking in with her at least 30 minutes before a date.   Okay so your serious and sophisticated charm is what’s gotten her hooked on to you but still you should try to loosen up and realize how lucky you are to have such a fun and lively girl by your side.   It’s stupid, prejudiced and only a total waste of time. Just because she has a bunch of friends dancing with her, is comfortable around opposite sex and shares a laugh or two with them doesn’t make her guilty of cheating on you. So, give that green face a rest and learn to be more trusting.   She is open to have you party hard with her. But there would be times she may just want to be surrounded with her friends and enjoy the night. Respect her feelings. If you love your space, love to be left alone to sleep, watch tv, read, go hiking or whatever, she’s got that right too.   Unless she’s a psychic who can read your thoughts, you need to let her know if something’s bothering you, whether it be her calling you in the wee hours of morning and waking you up or leaving her phone anywhere missing your calls all the time.   If she pukes on a stranger or sings terrible song in front of the crowd and still enjoys it, be happy for her. It’s rare to find someone who can laugh at oneself. Don’t feel embarrassed, instead take a cue from her and join the fun.   She could be really bad at being punctual but she does has some great skills that are admirable. Say, breaking ice with strangers like they never were any, organizing top notch parties or her mastery over making your hangover vanish in a jiffy.   A night in a club with her, some mixed tape of great techno music or just a keg of smooth liquor to enjoy with you… And she’ll be happy.   She is a party hopper so all you need is to take her to some great pub with fantastic music and food. But even apart from that you can always give it a thoughtful and personalized touch by taking her on long drive with peppy music to accompany you, discover crowds and new clubs or go to music festivals together. Also, don’t forget to take her on traditional dates sometimes as well. She’ll appreciate it.
If You Are Goofy, Here Are 12 Reasons Why She’ll Fall For You:	Whenever you ask a girl what qualities does she want in a guy, somehow ‘a good sense of humour’ is one thing that is never amiss. No girl can deny that a guy who can make her giggle like a silly school girl has something about him that’s absolutely electrifying and magnetic. So, if you are well habitual of making your friends snort with laughter, thank your goofy genes because while you are busy pulling an another Chandler, she maybe feeling an unknown attraction towards you right now.  And here is why. image source There’s never a dull moment with you around. You can cheer up anyone and make almost any gathering a lively party.   People need to struggle to keep pace with you while you leave no opportunity to crack a spontaneous joke. And who doesn’t love a witty joker?   Anyone can pull a fart joke but to make her laugh hard till her stomach starts hurting and her eyes watery is an art. Only a well knowledgeable person with a a treasure of funny voices and faces can manage to do that.   Debate took on an ugly turn or a friend got dumped? She knows they can leave it on the jester of the group to drop the temperature of the room. You have it in you to make the most appropriate wisecrack to lighten the dense atmosphere.   She knows that if they leave you in a room full of complete strangers and lock the door, it will only be a matter of minutes before they can hear the voices of laughter from inside. You are an expert at small talk and making friends.   You have the ability to keenly observe the tiniest of details in your environment and find the absurdness in them. This is what makes you a great comedian and imprints you on her mind.   When you can be goofy and laugh at yourself, she automatically finds herself getting comfortable. When with you, she can thus, laugh and not be embarrassed about anything.   Your social skill is what’s to thank for. You make every party a hit with your dry sarcasm, crazy impressions and well timed jokes. This is the reason why her friends tell her what a riot you are besides a great catch.   You would rather share punchlines than punches with anyone. You are known to keep your temper in check and take things easy without giving in to drama.   It takes a secure guy to poke someone or make fun of himself. It is but obvious that a guy who’s comfortable in his shoes will be attractive to her.   You could shoot a joke or two on yourself but it’s evident that humour is a way to mask the complex chest of emotions that lie deep inside of you. And when you are enough at ease to give a sneak peak of it to her, it makes her deeply long for you.   You know the perfect one-liner to make her smile even from the curtains of tears. Your cute smirk and your thoughtfulness is what makes her heart melt. And then my friend, how can she keep herself, from falling for you, that is, if she hasn’t already.

Have You Heard About Lonar Lake? – A Crater With An Impact:	Whenever we look at the wonders of nature, it makes us realize how mysterious the universe is. No matter how much we claim to know and understand it, there are and will always be phenomena that are beyond our comprehension. One such wondrous gift of nature is the Lonar Lake, one of Maharashtra’s best-kept secrets. The product of a prehistoric cosmic event, the lake has attracted visitors for its natural beauty, historic significance and religious references. Lonar is a small village in Buldhana district of Maharashtra and is about 380 Km from Pune, 370 Km from Mumbai, and 140kms from Aurangabad. You can book an trustworthy taxi service from Pune and visit Lonar. The Lonar Lake and its neighbourhood is the highlight of its namesake village and make for a quaint combination of science, religion, and folk culture. The natural water body is said to be formed some 52000 years ago, when a meteorite, weighing 2 million tonnes, crashed on the earth’s mantle at an estimated speed of 90,000 kmph. The impact of this huge astral body was profound enough to create a 1.8 Km wide and 150 meters deep hole. The current diameter of the lake is 1.2 Km and the water level is 137 meters deep. Major research and development institutions like the Smithsonian, the United States Geological Survey, Geological Society of India, the University of Sagar and the Physical Research Laboratory, etc. have conducted endless and extensive studies of both the Lonar and the Amber Lakes and its perimeters, with the objective of understanding the level of its cosmic impact. Over evolution of the planet, natural vegetation and rain water fed the crater, turning the void into a serene and verdant zone. The lush landscape has been a paradise for nature lovers, trekkers, and geologists, each with their own search of comprehending this mysterious landmark. While travelers find this greenish water body visually delightful and make this their escape into nature, scientists seek answers to most pertinent questions. A National Geo-Heritage Monument, the Lonar Lake is the only known hyper velocity impact crater in basaltic rock anywhere on Earth. Also, it it’s the only water body to be found today which is both alkaline and saline at the same time which is believed to support micro-organisms that are not found anywhere else on the planet. Geologists have also discovered that some areas of the crater makes any compass or measuring device dysfunctional, adding to the enigma of this blue-green ecosystem. A small circular depression called the Ambar Lake, lies about 700 meters from the main crater, and is said to be caused by the splinter that created the Lonar Lake. Locally, this smaller water body is also known as the ChhotaLonar (small Lonar). You can also find a Hanuman Temple near the lake area, whose idol is believed to have magnetic properties. The two distinct layers of water (outer saline and inner alkaline) have their own flora and fauna, making it a complete natural enclave. This entire zone is a haven for numerous rare and exotic species of plants, animals, and birds. In cooler months like monsoon or winter, you can spot plenty of resident and migratory birds like the black-winged stilts, common and ruddy Shelducks (European migrants), Shovellers, teals, herons, red-wattled lapwings, rollers or blue jays, Baya weavers, parakeets, hoopoes, larks, tailorbirds, magpies, robins, swallows, and many more. There are also lots of peafowls, chinkara, and gazelles, roaming in the forested areas adjoining the lake. Very recently, the entire lake area was declared as the Lonar Wildlife Sanctuary, in order to protect its life forms. Visually splendid and naturally bountiful, the mystical and mysterious Lonar Lake has a lot more to unearth its secrets that are still lurking in its bed, even after thousands of years. Travellers from Mumbai can book a trust-worthy and cheap car rental service and explore this unique region.

14 Bollywood Clichés Without Which No College Life Can Actually Be Complete:	Bollywood never gets old… And one of the proofs is it’s college based movies. OK… not really. But seriously, it has so many movies with colleges as backdrop that they have actually become cult films for the students. And although there are so many stupid clichés in them like the whole college dancing with you matching perfectly with your steps etc. etc. etc. that are not only silly but also too unrealistic; there are still others which are actually true of any given college. Let’s find out what are these. You just have to have a at least one crush on one of the faculty of whose class you never miss and who is the only one who believes you are a good and sincere student! image source / Red Chillies Entertainment- Eros International   It’s a must to secretly drink in the class… Maybe at the back bench or even at the back side of your college.

7 Must Have Characters Of Any Bollywood Movie:	We just can’t get enough of Bollywood movies but what we like even more than that is to laugh at their nonsensical and stereotypical characters that they don’t seem to get enough of putting there either! So, here are some typical Bollywood typecast that I am sure you would agree with. Don’t ever expect this guy to go back to his own house. He is here to stay with his buddy’s family, eat their food and run errands for them and assist his friend free of cost in all his madness soaked endeavours. image source / Tips Music Films- UTV Motion Pictures   She sticks to her guru mata , nods in agreement at everything, says dumb things and always dresses sloppily to make her hot (and high headed) friend even hotter. image source / Yash Raj Films   Dressed completely as a typical bhartiya naari , she is all for her husband and children. She would only do housework and mind you with full dedication and forget and forgive every wrong doing of his beloved family. image source   With work profile restricted completely to dancing in every song then disappearing immediately, she has nothing to contribute to the movie other than her unsolicited adaayein . But yes, she is always the reason for the villain getting killed. So, sincere thanks for getting kidnapped every time. image source / UTV Motion Pictures   If he’s a dad he’s gotta be strict, often so much that he would set his pet men on the hero for romancing his daughter or at least scratch him out of his will if he’s his own son. image source / Yash Raj Films   He is the demon born as a human. There can be nothing good in him at all. Name any crime and he would have done it all. And almost always meet his fate fighting one on one with the hero because y’all know dying with a bullet is just so junior level gunda style. image source / Eros International   Hero has another meaning in Bollywood… It means he can kill a hundred goons with a single punch and can put up a fight with a 7 ft., double in size villain and mix him up in dirt even after braving three bullets, getting his arms torn and legs broken. image source / Eros International
13 Motivational Bollywood Dialogues That You Never Thought Could Be Used In These Situations:	Bollywood is by no means deficient in great and memorable dialogues.

20 Interesting Bloopers Of Bollywood Movies:	While watching movies we come across loads of silly and illogical bloopers that inadvertently make us exclaim WTF! Bollywood movies are stuffed with such horrendous mistakes that lead us to think either they think they are extremely smart and will get away with anything or assume the audience to be stupid enough to not notice their boo boos. We saw poor SRK getting killed b y that wretched ahem game character and then buried in Christian ritual… But voila! As miraculously as the game character came to life, same way did SRK’s buried body turned to ashes for Kareena to do the last rites as per Hindu procedure.   Ranbir Kapoor takes away the nuisance of a book too while handling her luggage, from Deepika… But they don’t just say Knowledge is Power for nothing.. The omnipotent book is back in the lass’s hands the next instant.   In the movie Rohit Mehra is shown to be away in Singapore for a good 2 years period and still one fine day his mother calls him to break the news of Preity Zinta being pregnant!! OMG! Maybe that’s Jadoo!!   OMG! They remembered to use the new name and logo of ABP News (than its older Star News) on the TV channel… But forgot to change it for good on the mic. Shi*!   They sing this song Nanha Munna Rahi Hoon… Which is cute and inspiring as hell but the thing is the song was a part of a 1962 movie ‘Son of India’ while the movie sequence was set in the 1950s. Hmm… Maybe patriotism just spoke to him.   Apparently Tapasvi Maharaj was right about how you shouldn’t trust Sarfaraz. He said he works at Pakistan embassy in Bruges but as it turns out there’s isn’t one… Though Brussels does.   Moreover who could tell Kalyan Express can become Durronto too just for Sanjay baba?   SRK has a lot of trouble with ashes it seems. He is seen happily putting the urn containing his Grandpa’s asthiyaan (ashes) in his bag before leaving for Goa. But in somehow his Granny hands him the same urn on the railway platform while he’e about to leave.   It seems like they director had a vision and he broadcast the Gujrat riots of 2002 on a channel Headlines Today which was yet to take birth a yea from then in 2003. We need such visionaries, don’t we?   The opening scene sees three friends arriving at a dhaba tripling on a motor bike… But as the scene gives way to a song, they are seen leaving in a jeep! Mmm…. transforming bike! Can we have one too?   Suhas is already at the venue, getting ready and humming something gibberish while trimming his nose hair.. (Eww)… But something crazy happened and he found himself kicked out of the venue and hysterically making entrance from the main gate! What an idiot…. Not him.. The direc… Nevermind.   They say you can’t see ghosts in cameras. Well this could be the only reason why the musicians who were playing on Raghu’s right when he went to meet Harman.. Disappeared without a trace when its CCTV camera footage was seen. *Goosebumps*   Disappearing mystery just gets weirder. When Raghu flings wine, there the nasty stuff ruining the whole wall and the painting on it… But the next instant it’s spotlessly clean! (Psst… mom is asking which cleaner did they use. Anyone?)   Set in 1982 the movie is shown to have a game of cricket consisting of an over with 6 balls but back in that time there were only 5 allowed. Howwzzaattt?!   The right front door of the SUV is completely damaged but the next instant its all hammered and polished and as brand as new! Well done boys… Your garage’s address please?   Heard the term ‘remote sensing’? Now, witness remote dressing.   Its good the timid girl was travelling on her own and exploring but we recommend to check before sitting in a train; for all we know the train she was boarding that was supposed to go from Paris (France) to Amsterdam (Netherlands)… …was a sprinter that only runs in Netherlands and definitely doesn’t cross borders!   We saw omnipotent… It’s time to witness the omnipresence now. See these guys strumming the guitar and doing jugalbandi as Shraddha kapoor croons… Now behold as they are backstage too chatting and all… Respect!   You know the Tomatina Festival that tempted you as hell to play it yourself, that’s celebrated in August.. And that scary half as*ed bull chase? Well that’s celebrated in July… So ideally it should have been sported before the fun natural facial festival of La Tomatina.   When Prem sets off to meet Sandhya it’s in this baby… But perhaps it took them years to reach her place or God knows what… It turned into this oldie… Hmm… Omni Van bhi Complan peeti hai … grew up so fast.

Baaghi: A Story That Talks About Rebels in Love:	Haven’t we all always been fascinated about love stories?  Bollywood has been delivering cliché love stories to our audience for decades, and we would all still flock at the theatres to watch them like we didn’t know the ending. I think it is time we all agree upon the fact that Bollywood love stories are the staple of our country. No matter how many different kinds of concepts keep coming our way, a comforting love story is what makes into our everyday guilty pleasures to feel better about life. Another story on the same lines, but not cliché is what  Baaghi  is all about. They start the story with two rebels who always fight with each other or with others to get their things done. The lead actors Ronnie (Tiger Shroff) and Sia (Shraddha Kapoor) hit off their love story amidst beautiful backdrops of undisturbed forests. Ronnie, who is a martial arts academy student, comes across Sia. Being the rebels they are, the couple tends to stay put to their ego and refrains from feelings for each other. At the same institute, Ronnie finds a guru who tells him ‘ Baaghi  bano, par kisi maqsad ke liye.’ This dialogue is pretty much the crux of the movie, giving us all the reasons why we should watch Baaghi on ZEE5 now. A still from the movie! After Ronnie and Sia fall in love over a brief time, then enters the villain Raghav (Sudheer Babu) who also falls head over heels for Sia. He feels that Sia is the right match to his attitude, and hence decides that she is the perfect match for him. Following this, he gets to know about Ronnie and Sia and decides to kidnap her. He takes her to Bangkok where Ronnie and Raghav come face-to-face to fight for their ladylove. The film carries a certain kind of charm with a little humour here and there added by the fights put up by Tiger Shroff. Shroff does complete justice to his character, with an immense improvement from his previous film, whereas Kapoor keeps up her charm and acting despite being restricted to a damsel in distress. The action sequences are choreographed in a rather stunning way, making it almost difficult for you to turn your eyes away. This 2 hours 20-minute long movie gives you enough entertainment on a laid-back evening. Shraddha Kapoor, being her pretty-self, delivers some punches and packs here and there, showing the rebel in her character. Whereas the talented Tiger Shroff is sure to carry you away with his emotions and flared muscles that are very candy to the eye. The best part about Baaghi is that the fights are based on the traditional way of dealing with the hands rather than guns and weapons, which makes the cut for this movie. The movie received some good reviews from some of the leading critics like  Anupama Chopra,  Rajeev Masand and similar ones, pouring all praises for Tiger Shroff and Shraddha Kapoor. With the birthdays of the lead actors Tiger Shroff (2nd March) and Shraddha Kapoor (3rd March) approaching soon, there is yet another reason to revisit their performances and give them a thumbs up by watching Baaghi!

Kaafir, A Tale Winning Millions Heart:	Kaafir, the ZEE5 Original web series has been the talk of the town since launch. Starring Dia Mirza and Mohit Raina in the lead, the web series shows the journey of Kainaaz Akhtar, resident of POK who crosses over to India and is held as a prisoner. It portrays the beautiful relationship the mother Kainaaz and her daughter Seher share and their fight to return back legally to Pakistan. All the eight episodes keep you hooked and leave you with some questions to answer about the struggles and bonds. Inspired by a true story, Kaafir is a tale worth telling the masses. The simplicity and innocence of the child are in complete sync with the struggles and tortures her mother faces. The journalist cum lawyer, Vedant played by Mohit Raina has his own share of efforts to overcome. Having lost his brother to militant, he saved from imprisonment a few months backfill him with never-ending guilt. This is what forces him to take up Kainaaz’s case, and the bond shared by Kainaaz and Vedant speaks volumes in itself. (Click  here  to see Mohit Raina’s interview with The Indian Express about his role in Kaafir, why he chose the project and more.) Kaafir tells the tale of two warring nations, its politics and society and gender oppression. Kainaaz, played by Dia Mirza, showcases the emotions of a victim perfectly. The commendable acting by her evokes sympathy and compassion for her character by the audiences. Her mental trauma and constant efforts to free her will force you to question about the struggles people face who accidentally cross borders. What’s the best part of this endearing tale? Kaafir draws the similarities between two different nations and its people in terms of culture, lifestyle, food and most importantly, emotions. What is shared between the two countries is the love between a mother and her child and the struggles we all face every day. Indians and Pakistan share many things in common: Kafir has been clearly defined in Quran – they are not non-muslims but are thought so by the Muslims or Moin. People have a challenging life at the borders – and we need to be sympathetic towards them for the same. According to Quran- Kafir is the one who conceals the fact, is ungrateful and kafirejects Quran. Be it an Indian or a Pakistani, both are peace lovers and that is why you must be empathetic, kind and helpful towards the ones struggling at the borders. If you are looking for some exciting web series to watch this week, watch this intriguing tale Kaafir and we are sure you will just love it.
List Of Quirky Bollywood Movies About Con Men:	You know the saying right, that TRUST is a dangerous game. On a desperate attempt to watch something good this weekend, I stumbled upon this movie called The Wolf of Wall Street’. Though I’m literally watching this for the 50th time, I can’t help but get awestruck by DiCaprio’s portrayal of Jordan Belfort every time and this got me more passionate about con artist movies. And it is this inclination that got me looking for some of the best Bollywood movies about con men. So in this list, we are listing down movies that are based on con artists. Also, I will not be condoning any movie based on a bank heist or robbery, so as great as it is, Dhoom series did not make into this list. The Fakir of Venice Presented in the 2009 Indian Film Festival, it took The Fakir of Venice 10 years to find its way into Bollywood. This 2019 movie is about a young man Aadhi (played by Farhan Akhtar) who only cares about money and would do anything to get it, even if it means going underground, literally. Though the movie is over 10 years old, the crux of the movie is still fresh and entertaining, making it an enjoyable watch even in 2019. Also, The Fakir of Venice movie is supposed to be the debut movie for Farhan Akhtar. Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl In this movie, Ranveer Singh makes girls fall prey for his tricks with his charming attitude. While some found this movie extremely misogynistic, I think there is nothing fair when it comes to cheating someone for money. For what it’s worth, Ranveer leaves his past behind and starts a new life by the end of the movie, so I think that makes up for what he has done in the past. Raja Natwarlal This 2014 Bollywood movie features Emraan Hashmi as Raja who cons people for his livelihood. On an attempt to make a big catch, Hashmi ends up stealing the money of Billionaire Varda Yadav (played by Kay Kay Menon) who just can’t stand the thought of getting robbed by two cons and orders his goons to kill them. The thrilling chase that follows forms the rest of the film. Music added an extra element of emotion to the film, all thanks to Yuvan Shankar Raja who did his Bollywood debut through this movie. Special 26 No one batted an eyelid when they Akshay Kumar played the role of a con man who does fake CBI raids to steal money from the rich. The movie was so good, in fact, that it was later remade in Tamil as Thaanaa Serndha Koottam. The movie tasted a massive success at the box office, proving good movies are always welcomed by the audience. While we all like seeing Akshay Kumar in righteous roles, this is one movie you just can’t afford to miss out. We are pretty con-fident that these are some of the best movies of Bollywood in this list, puns intended. Con-sidering how much we love these movies, I think you are going to have to have a fun time watching it.
